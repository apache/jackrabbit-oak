### Clustering

Clustering is currently supported for the MongoDB and RDBMs storage subsystems.

To use clustering, simply connect multiple Oak instances with the same backend storage.

Please note the RDBMS storage is work in progress, 
and will soon be fully tested and supported as well.
Both the MongoDB and the RDBMs storage subsystems internally use the same 
cluster mechanism.
