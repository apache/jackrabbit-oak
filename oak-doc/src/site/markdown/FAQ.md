# Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)

<!-- MACRO{toc} -->

## I get a warning "Traversed 1000 nodes ...", what does that mean?

You might be missing an index. See [Query engine](query.html).

## I get a warning "Attempt to perform ... while another thread is concurrently ...", what is wrong?

You are accessing a `Session` instance concurrently from multiple threads. Session instances are
[not thread safe](dos_and_donts.html#Anti_pattern:_concurrent_session_access).
Enabling `DEBUG` logging for `SessionDelegate` provides stack traces for both sessions involved. 
*Note*: this should be used for debugging only as it has a major impact on system performance.

## My repository size on disk is growing beyond control (SegmentNodeStore)

You need to setup a regular job for [compacting the segments](nodestore/segmentmk.html#Segment_Compaction).

## How do I debug merge conflict errors

Debugging merge conflict errors is now possible by enabling `DEBUG` logs on
`org.apache.jackrabbit.oak.plugins.commit.MergingNodeStateDiff` and
`org.apache.jackrabbit.oak.plugins.commit.ConflictValidator`. 
This option is available via [OAK-3057](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/OAK-3057) since Oak 1.0.17, 1.2.3, 1.3.3.
