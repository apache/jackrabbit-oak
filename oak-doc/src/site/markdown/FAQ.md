#Â Frequently asked questions

#### I get a warning "Traversed 1000 nodes ...", what does that mean?

You might be missing an index. See [Query engine](query.html).


#### I get a warning "Attempt to perform ... while another thread is concurrently ...", what is wrong?

You are accessing a `Session` instance concurrently from multiple threads. Session instances are
[not thread safe](dos_and_donts.html#Anti_pattern:_concurrent_session_access).
Enabling `DEBUG` logging for `SessionDelegate` provides stack traces for both sessions involved. 
*Note*: this should be used for debugging only as it has a major impact on system performance.

#### I have a SegmentMK store and the size is growing beyond control

You need to setup a regular job for [compacting the segments](nodestore/segmentmk.html#Segment_Compaction).

#### My question is not listed here

Search the [Oak dev list](http://jackrabbit.markmail.org/search/+list:org.apache.jackrabbit.oak-dev)
and the [Oak issue tracker](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/OAK). If you still can't find an
answer ask on [the list](participating.html).
