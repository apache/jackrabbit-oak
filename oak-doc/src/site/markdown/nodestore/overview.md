# Node Storage

Oak comes with two node storage flavours: [Segment](segmentmk.html) and [Document](documentmk.html). 
Segment storage is optimised for maximal performance in standalone deployments,
and document storage is optimised for maximal scalability in clustered deployments.

## NodeStore API

The node storage implement the `NodeStore` APIs.
Those are ultimately representations of the
[node state model](../architecture/nodestate.html). 
The `NodeStore` exposes its functionality through a pure Java API,
which is suited to work with in Java, and has lower performance and memory overhead.

## MicroKernel API

The `MicroKernel` API was deprecated in OAK 1.2 and dropped from the project as of
Oak 1.3.0. It used to exposes its functionality through a String only (JSON) API.
