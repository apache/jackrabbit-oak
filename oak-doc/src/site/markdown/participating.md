We generally follow a [CTR](https://www.apache.org/foundation/glossary.html#CommitThenReview) policy. 
However it is up to each individual committer to pro-actively ask for a review of a patch on 
oak-dev@ or to even call for a [RTC](https://www.apache.org/foundation/glossary.html#ReviewThenCommit). 
Special care should be taken with backports to maintenance branches. Back ports bear a certain risk 
of introducing regressions to otherwise stable branches. Each back ported change should be carefully 
evaluated for its potential impact, risk and possible mitigation. It is the responsibility of each 
committer to asses these and ask for advise or reviewing on oak-dev@ if uncertain. Whether using 
RTC or CTR is up to the committer.
