# Participating

## Mailing Lists

The best place for Oak-related discussions is the [oak-dev@](mailto:oak-dev@jackrabbit.apache.org)
mailing list. To subscribe, send a message to [oak-dev-subscribe@](mailto:oak-dev-subscribe@jackrabbit.apache.org).

For more details related to various mailing list have a look at http://jackrabbit.apache.org/mailing-lists.html.

## Issue Tracking

Use the [OAK issue tracker](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/OAK) to submit issues, comments 
or patches. To subscribe to issue notifications, send a message to
[oak-issues@](mailto:oak-issues-subscribe@jackrabbit.apache.org).

- On "trunk": when done with a ticket, set it to "resolved" and set "Fix Version"
  to the next unreleased version. Our workflow does not allow re-opening a
  closed ticket, so we close tickets only when a public release has been made
  with that change. Until that happens, a ticket can always be re-opened
  and further work can happen.
- On maintenance branch (currently 1.22): re-use the existing Jira ticket and
  just add to "Fix Version" (unless the backport is complex).
- Add "Affects Version" and "Fix Version" as and when applicable (but not
  otherwise).
- Be careful not to include sensitive information (be it in descriptions,
  attachments, or log files).
 - Feel free to comment in the ticket what is being worked on. Eg to mention work starts in a certain branch B, or that the PR is ready for review, or that it is merged. It can make it easier for others to follow.

## Source Code

The latest Oak sources are available on [GitHub](https://github.com/apache/jackrabbit-oak).

### Making Changes

We generally follow a [CTR](https://www.apache.org/foundation/glossary.html#CommitThenReview) policy.
However it is up to each individual committer to pro-actively ask for a review of a patch on
oak-dev@ or to even call for a [RTC](https://www.apache.org/foundation/glossary.html#ReviewThenCommit).

#### API Changes

We use the Maven "baseline" plugin to maintain semantic versioning Information
for packages. When it asks for a version bump, make sure that the implications
are fully understood. If it asks for a *major* version bump, that implies that
the new version is incompatible with previous releases. This should only happen
in very rare circumstances; in doubt, it should be reviewed by experienced
committers.

#### New Dependencies

Introduction of new dependencies should be discussed on [oak-dev@](mailto:oak-dev@jackrabbit.apache.org)
first; it is important that their license is compatible with Apache's, that
they are stable and follow the principle of [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/).

#### Backports

Special care should be taken with backports to maintenance branches, in
particular when the public API is affected. Back ports bear a certain risk of
introducing regressions to otherwise stable branches. Each back ported change
should be carefully evaluated for its potential impact, risk and possible
mitigation. It is the responsibility of each committer to asses these and ask
for advice or reviewing on oak-dev@ if uncertain. Whether using RTC or CTR is
up to the committer.

#### Pull Requests (PRs)

- Minimize PRs; do not modify whitespace/coding style except where needed. This
  makes them much easier to review, also minimizes confusion when using
  "git blame".
- Structure tickets/PRs so that things that can be separated are (that can be
  useful for backports and reverts).
- Have test cases (when there's no immediate fix, create a ticket and a PR just
  for the test and mark it "ignored", pointing to the actual issue).
- PRs that contain multiple commits in general should be "squashed and merged".
- When new files are added, make sure they have the proper license on it
  (in doubt, run the build with "-Prat").
- after merging a PR consider deleting the branch unless it should be kept
#### Commits

- Always reference an Oak ticket for each commit/PR (this should include the JIRA id
  in the correct format, e.g. "OAK-10881" instead of "Oak 10881").
- Avoid committing unfinished stuff; in particular when a release is approaching
  (see [UNRELEASED](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/OAK?selectedItem=com.atlassian.jira.jira-projects-plugin%3Arelease-page&status=unreleased))

### Coding Style

- Please avoid wildcard imports.
- In general be consistent with the style of the code being modified.
- Avoid TABs, non-ASCII characters, and trailing whitespace.
