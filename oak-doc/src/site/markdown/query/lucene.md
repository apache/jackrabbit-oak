## Lucene Index

**Following details are applicable for Oak release 1.0.9 onwards. For pre 1.0
.9 release refer to [Pre 1.0.9 Lucene documentation](lucene-old.html)**

Oak supports Lucene based indexes to support both property constraint and full
text constraints. Depending on the configuration a Lucene index can be used
to evaluate property constraints, full text constraints, path restrictions
and sorting.

    SELECT * FROM [nt:base] WHERE [assetType] = 'image'

Following index definition would allow using Lucene index for above query

```
/oak:index/assetType
  - jcr:primaryType = "oak:QueryIndexDefinition"
  - compatVersion = 2
  - type = "lucene"
  - async = "async"
  + indexRules
    - jcr:primaryType = "nt:unstructured"
    + nt:base
      + properties
        - jcr:primaryType = "nt:unstructured"
        + assetType
          - propertyIndex = true
          - name = "assetType"
```

The index definition node for a lucene-based index

* must be of type `oak:QueryIndexDefinition`
* must have the `type` property set to __`lucene`__
* must contain the `async` property set to the value `async`, this is what
  sends the index update process to a background thread

_Note that compared to [Property Index](query.html#property-index) Lucene
Property Index is always configured in Async mode hence it might lag behind
in reflecting the current repository state while performing the query_

Taking another example. To support following query

    //*[jcr:contains(., 'text')]

The Lucene index needs to be configured to index all properties

    /oak:index/assetType
      - jcr:primaryType = "oak:QueryIndexDefinition"
      - compatVersion = 2
      - type = "lucene"
      - async = "async"
      + indexRules
        - jcr:primaryType = "nt:unstructured"
        + nt:base
          + properties
            - jcr:primaryType = "nt:unstructured"
            + allProps
              - name = ".*"
              - isRegexp = true
              - nodeScopeIndex = true

### Index Definition

Lucene index definition consist of `indexingRules`, `analyzers` ,
`aggregates` etc which determine which node and properties are to be indexed
and how they are indexed.

Below is the canonical index definition structure

    luceneIndex (oak:QueryIndexDefinition)
      - type (string) = 'lucene' mandatory
      - async (string) = 'async' mandatory
      - blobSize (long) = 32768
      - maxFieldLength (long) = 10000
      - evaluatePathRestrictions (boolean) = false
      - name (string)
      - compatVersion (long) = 2
      - includedPaths (string) multiple
      - excludedPaths (string) multiple
      - indexPath (string)
      - codec (string)
      + indexRules (nt:unstructured)
      + aggregates (nt:unstructured)
      + analyzers (nt:unstructured)
      + tika (nt:unstructured)

Following are the config options which can be defined at the index definition
level

type
: Required and should always be `lucene`

async
: Required and should always be `async`

[blobSize][OAK-2201]
: Default value 32768 (32kb)
: Size in bytes used for splitting the index files when storing them in NodeStore

functionName
: Name to be used to enable index usage with [native query support](#native-query)

evaluatePathRestrictions
: Optional boolean property defaults to `false`
: If enabled the index can evaluate [path restrictions](#path-restrictions)

includedPaths
: Optional multi value property. Defaults to '/'
: List of paths which should be [included](#include-exclude) in indexing. 

excludedPaths
: Optional multi value property. Defaults to empty
: List of paths which should be [excluded](#include-exclude) from indexing. 

indexPath
: Optional string property to specify [index path](#copy-on-write)
: Path of the index definition in the repository. For e.g. if the index
  definition is specified at `/oak:index/lucene` then set this path in `indexPath` 

codec
: Optional string property
: Name of the [Lucene codec](#codec) to use

name
: Optional property
: Captures the name of the index which is used while logging

compatVersion
: Required integer property and should be set to 2
: By default Oak uses older Lucene index implementation which does not
  supports property restrictions, index time aggregation etc. 
  To make use of this feature set it to 2.
  Please note for full text indexing with compatVersion 2, 
  at query time, only the access right of the parent (aggregate) node is checked, 
  and the access right of the child nodes is not checked.
  If this is a security concern, then compatVersion should not be set,
  so that query time aggregation is used, in which case the access right
  of the relevant child is also checked.
  A compatVersion 2 full text index is usually faster to run queries.

[maxFieldLength][OAK-2469]
: Numbers of terms indexed per field. Defaults to 10000

#### Indexing Rules

Indexing rules defines which types of node and properties are indexed. An
index configuration can define one or more `indexingRules` for different
nodeTypes.

    fulltextIndex
      - jcr:primaryType = "oak:QueryIndexDefinition"
      - compatVersion = 2
      - type = "lucene"
      - async = "async"
      + indexRules
        - jcr:primaryType = "nt:unstructured"
        + app:Page
          + properties
            - jcr:primaryType = "nt:unstructured"
            + publishedDate
              - propertyIndex = true
              - name = "jcr:content/publishedDate"
        + app:Asset
          + properties
            - jcr:primaryType = "nt:unstructured"
            + imageType
              - propertyIndex = true
              - name = "jcr:content/metadata/imageType"

Rules are defined per nodeType and each rule has one or more property
definitions determine which properties are indexed. Below is the canonical index
definition structure

    ruleName (nt:unstructured)
      - inherited (boolean) = true
      - indexNodeName (boolean) = false
      - includePropertyTypes (string) multiple
      + properties (nt:unstructured)

Following are the config options which can be defined at the index rule
level

inherited
: Optional boolean property defaults to true
: Determines if the rule is applicable on exact match or can be applied if
  match is done on basis of nodeType inheritance

includePropertyTypes
: Applicable when index is enabled for fulltext indexing
: For full text index defaults to include all types
: String array of property types which should be indexed. The values can be one
  specified in [PropertyType Names][1]
  
<a name="index-node-name"></a>  
indexNodeName
: `@since Oak 1.0.20, 1.2.5`
: Default to false. If set to true then index would also be created for node name.
  This would enable faster evaluation of queries involving constraints on Node 
  name. For example
    * _select [jcr:path] from [nt:base] where NAME() = 'kite'_
    * _select [jcr:path] from [nt:base] where NAME() LIKE 'kite%'_
    * //kite
    * //*[jcr:like(fn:name(), 'kite%')]
    * //element(*, app:Asset)[fn:name() = 'kite'] 
    * //element(kite, app:Asset)

##### Cost Overrides

By default, the cost of using this index is calculated follows: For each query,
the overhead is one operation. For each entry in the index, the cost is one.
The following only applies to `compatVersion` 2 only:
To use use a lower or higher cost, you can set the following optional properties
in the index definition:

    - costPerExecution (Double) = 1.0
    - costPerEntry (Double) = 1.0

Please note that typically, those settings don't need to be explicitly set.
Cost per execution is the overhead of one query. 
Cost per entry is the cost per node in the index. 
Using 0.5 means the cost is half, which means the index would be used used more often 
(that is, even if there is a different index with similar cost).

##### Indexing Rule inheritance

`indexRules` are defined per nodeType and support nodeType inheritance. For
example while indexing any node the indexer would lookup for applicable
indexRule for that node based on its _primaryType_. If a direct match is
found then that rule would be used otherwise it would look for rule for any
of the parent types. The rules are looked up in the order of there entry
under `indexRules` node (indexRule node itself is of type `nt:unstructured`
which has `orderable` child nodes)

If `inherited` is set to false on any rule then that rule would only be
applicable if exact match is found

##### Property Definitions

Each index rule consist of one ore more property definition defined under
`properties`. Order of property definition node is important as some properties
are based on regular expressions. Below is the canonical property definition
structure

    propNode (nt:unstructured)
      - name (string)
      - boost (double) = '1.0'
      - index (boolean) = true
      - useInExcerpt (boolean) = false
      - analyzed (boolean) = false
      - nodeScopeIndex (boolean) = false
      - ordered (boolean) = false
      - isRegexp (boolean) = false
      - type (string) = 'undefined'
      - propertyIndex (boolean) = false
      - nullCheckEnabled (boolean) = false

Following are the details about the above mentioned config options which can be
defined at the property definition level

name
: Property name. If not defined then property name is set to the node name.
  If `isRegexp` is true then it defines the regular expression. Can also be set
  to a relative property.

isRegexp
: If set to true then property name would be interpreted as a regular
  expression and the given definition would be applicable for matching property
  names. Note that expression should be structured such that it does not
  match '/'.
    * `.*` - This property definition is applicable for all properties of given
      node
    * `jcr:content/metadata/.*` - This property definition is
      applicable for all properties of child node _jcr:content/metadata_

boost
: If the property is included in `nodeScopeIndex` then it defines the boost
  done for the index value against the given property name. See 
  [Boost and Search Relevancy](#boost) for more details

index
: Determines if this property should be indexed. Mostly useful for fulltext
  index where some properties need to be _excluded_ from getting indexed.

useInExcerpt
: Controls whether the value of a property should be used to create an excerpt.
  The value of the property is still full-text indexed when set to false, but it
  will never show up in an excerpt for its parent node. If set to true then
  property value would be stored separately within index causing the index
  size to increase. So set it to true only if you make use of excerpt feature

nodeScopeIndex
: Control whether the value of a property should be part of fulltext index. That
  is, you can do a _jcr:contains(., 'foo')_ and it will return nodes that have a
  string property that contains the word foo. Example
    * _//element(*, app:Asset)[jcr:contains(., 'image')]_

  In case of aggregation all properties would be indexed at node level by default
  if the property type is part of `includePropertyTypes`. However if there is an
  explicit property definition provided then it would only be included if
  `nodeScopeIndex` is set to true.
  
analyzed
: Set this to true if the property is used as part of `contains`. Example
    * _//element(*, app:Asset)[jcr:contains(type, 'image')]_
    * _//element(*, app:Asset)[jcr:contains(jcr:content/metadata/@format, 'image')]_

ordered
: If the property is to be used in _order by_ clause to perform sorting then
  this should be set to true. This should be set to true only if the property
  is to be used to perform sorting as it increases the index size. Example
    * _//element(*, app:Asset)[jcr:contains(type, 'image')] order by @size_
    * _//element(*, app:Asset)[jcr:contains(type, 'image')] order by
    jcr:content/@jcr:lastModified_

  Refer to [Lucene based Sorting][OAK-2196] for more details

type
: JCR Property type. Can be one of `Date`, `Boolean`, `Double` or `Long`. Mostly
  inferred from the indexed value. However in some cases where same property
  type is not used consistently across various nodes then it would recommened
   to specify the type explicitly.
   
propertyIndex
: Whether the index for this property is used for equality conditions, ordering, 
  and is not null conditions.

nullCheckEnabled
: Since 1.0.12
: If the property is checked for _is null_ then this should be set to true. This
  should only be enabled for nodeTypes which are not generic as it leads to index
  entry for all nodes of that type where this property is not set.
    * _//element(*, app:Asset)[not(jcr:content/@excludeFromSearch)]

  It would be better to use a query which checks for property existence or property
  being set to specific values as such queries can make use of index without any
  extra storage cost.

  Refer to [IS NULL support][OAK-2517] for more details

**Property Names**

Property name can be one of following

1. Simple name - Like _assetType_ etc. These are used for properties which are
   defined directly on the indexed node
2. Relative name - Like _jcr:content/metadata/title_. These are used for
   properties which are defined relative to the node being indexed.
3. Regular Expression - Like _.*_. Used when only property whose name
   match given pattern are to be indexed.
   They can also be used for relative properties like
   _jcr:content/metadata/dc:.*$_
   which indexes all property names starting with _dc_ from node with
   relative path _jcr:content/metadata_

<a name="path-restrictions"></a>
##### Evaluate Path Restrictions

Lucene index provides support for evaluating path restrictions natively.
Consider a query like

    select * from [app:Asset] as a where isdescendantnode(a, [/content/app/old]) AND contains(*, 'white')

By default the index would return all node which _contain white_ and Query
engine would filter out nodes which are not under _/content/app/old_. This
can perform slow if lots of nodes are not under that path. To speed up such
queries one can enable `evaluatePathRestrictions` in Lucene index and index
would only return nodes which are under _/content/app/old_.

Enabling this feature would incur cost in terms of slight increase in index
size. Refer to [OAK-2306][OAK-2306] for more details.

<a name="include-exclude"></a>
##### Include and Exclude paths from indexing

`@since Oak 1.0.14, 1.2.3`

By default the indexer would index all the nodes under the subtree where the 
index  definition is defined as per the indexingRule. In some cases its required
to index nodes under certain path. For e.g. if index is defined for global
fulltext index which include the complete repository you might want to exclude
certain path which contains transient system data. 

For example if you application stores certain logs under `/var/log` and it is 
not supposed to be indexed as part of fulltext index then it can be excluded

    /oak:index/assetType
      - jcr:primaryType = "oak:QueryIndexDefinition"
      - compatVersion = 2
      - type = "lucene"
      - excludedPaths = ["/var/log"]
      
Above index definition would cause nodes under `/var/log` not to be indexed.
In majority of case `excludedPaths` only makes sense. However in some cases
it might be required to also specify explicit set of path which should be 
indexed. In that case make use of `includedPaths`

Refer to [OAK-2599][OAK-2599] for more details.

<a name="aggregation"></a>
#### Aggregation

Sometimes it is useful to include the contents of descendant nodes into a single
node to easier search on content that is scattered across multiple nodes.

Oak allows you to define index aggregates based on relative path patterns and
primary node types. Changes to aggregated items cause the main item to be
reindexed, even if it was not modified.

Aggregation configuration is defined under the `aggregates` node under index
configuration. The following example creates an index aggregate on nt:file that
includes the content of the jcr:content node:

    fulltextIndex
      - jcr:primaryType = "oak:QueryIndexDefinition"
      - compatVersion = 2
      - type = "lucene"
      - async = "async"
      + aggregates
        + nt:file
          + include0
            - path = "jcr:content"

For a given nodeType multiple includes can be defined. Below is the aggregate
definition structure for any specific include rule

    aggregateNodeInclude (nt:unstructured)
      - path (string) mandatory
      - primaryType (string)
      - relativeNode (boolean) = false

Following are the details about the above mentioned config options which can be
defined as part of aggregation include. (Refer to [OAK-2268][OAK-2268] for
implementation details)

path
: Path pattern to include. Example
    * `jcr:content` - Name explicitly specified
    * `*` - Any child node at depth 1
    * `*/*` - Any child node at depth 2

primaryType
: Restrict the included nodes to a certain type. The restriction would be
  applied on the last node in given path

        + aggregates
          + nt:file
            + include0
              - path = "jcr:content"
              - primaryType = "nt:resource"

relativeNode
: Boolean property indicates that query can be performed against specific node
  For example for following content

        + space.txt (app:Asset)
          + renditions (nt:folder)
            + original (nt:file)
              + jcr:content (nt:resource)
                - jcr:data

  And a query like

        select * from [app:Asset] where contains(renditions/original/*, "pluto")

  Following index configuration would be required

        fulltextIndex
          - jcr:primaryType = "oak:QueryIndexDefinition"
          - compatVersion = 2
          - type = "lucene"
          - async = "async"
          + aggregates
            + nt:file
              + include0
                - path = "jcr:content"
            + app:Asset
              + include0
                - path = "renditions/original"
                - relativeNode = true
          + indexRules
            - jcr:primaryType = "nt:unstructured"
            + app:Asset

**Aggregation and Recursion**

While performing aggregation the aggregation rules are again applied on node
being aggregated. For example while aggregating for _app:Asset_ above when
_renditions/original/*_ is being aggregated then aggregation rule would again
be applied. In this case as  _renditions/original_ is _nt:file_ then aggregation
rule applicable for _nt:file_ would be applied. Such a logic might result in
recursion. (See [JCR-2989][JCR-2989] for details).

For such case `reaggregateLimit` is set on aggregate definition node and
defaults to 5

      + aggregates
        + app:Asset
          - reaggregateLimit (long) = 5
          + include0
            - path = "renditions/original"
            - relativeNode = true

#### Analyzers

`@since Oak 1.2.0`

Analyzers can be configured as part of index definition via `analyzers` node.
The default analyzer can be configured via `analyzers/default` node

    + sampleIndex
        - jcr:primaryType = "oak:QueryIndexDefinition"
        + analyzers
            + default
            + pathText
            ...

##### Specify analyzer class directly

If any of the out of the box analyzer is to be used then it can configured directly

    + analyzers
            + default
                - class = "org.apache.lucene.analysis.standard.StandardAnalyzer"
                - luceneMatchVersion = "LUCENE_47" (optional)

To confirm to specific version specify it via `luceneMatchVersion` otherwise Oak
would use a default version depending on version of Lucene it is shipped with.

One can also provide a stopword file via `stopwords` `nt:file` node under
the analyzer node

    + analyzers
            + default
                - class = "org.apache.lucene.analysis.standard.StandardAnalyzer"
                - luceneMatchVersion = "LUCENE_47" (optional)
                + stopwords (nt:file)

##### Create analyzer via composition

Analyzers can also be composed based on `Tokenizers`, `TokenFilters` and
`CharFilters`. This is similar to the support provided in Solr where you can
[configure analyzers in xml][solr-analyzer]

    + analyzers
            + default
                + charFilters (nt:unstructured) //The filters needs to be ordered
                    + HTMLStrip
                    + Mapping
                + tokenizer
                    - name = "Standard"
                + filters (nt:unstructured) //The filters needs to be ordered
                    + LowerCase
                    + Stop
                        - words = "stop1.txt, stop2.txt"
                        + stop1.txt (nt:file)
                        + stop2.txt (nt:file)
                    + PorterStem

Points to note

1. Name of filters, charFilters and tokenizer are formed by removing the
   factory suffixes. So
    * org.apache.lucene.analysis.standard.StandardTokenizerFactory -> standard
    * org.apache.lucene.analysis.charfilter.MappingCharFilterFactory -> Mapping
    * org.apache.lucene.analysis.core.StopFilterFactory -> Stop
2. Any config parameter required for the factory is specified as property of
   that node
    * If the factory requires to load a file e.g. stop words from some file then
      file content can be provided via creating child `nt:file` node of the
      filename

<a name="codec"></a>
#### Codec

Name of [Lucene Codec][lucene-codec] to use. By default if the index involves 
fulltext indexing then Oak Lucene uses `OakCodec` which disables compression.
Due to this the index size may grow large. To enable compression you can set
the codec to `Lucene46`

    /oak:index/assetType
      - jcr:primaryType = "oak:QueryIndexDefinition"
      - compatVersion = 2
      - type = "lucene"
      - codec = "Lucene46"
      
Refer to [OAK-2853][OAK-2853] for details. Enabling the `Lucene46` codec
would lead to smaller and compact indexes.

<a name="boost"></a>
#### Boost and Search Relevancy

`@since Oak 1.2.5`

When fulltext indexing is enabled then internally Oak would create a fulltext
field which consists of text extracted from various other fields i.e. fields 
for which `nodeScopeIndex` is `true`. This allows search like 
`//*[jcr:contains(., 'foo')]` to perform search across any indexable field 
containing foo (See [contains function][jcr-contains] for details)

In certain cases its desirable that those nodes where the searched term is present
in a specific property are ranked higher (come earlier in search result) compared
to those node where the searched term is found in some other property.

In such cases it should be possible to boost specific text contributed by 
individual property. Meaning that if a title field is boosted more than description, 
then search result would those node coming earlier where searched term is found
in title field

For that to work ensure that for each such property (which need to be preferred)
both `nodeScopeIndex` and `analyzed` are set to true. In addition you can specify 
`boost` property so give higher weightage to values found in specific property

Note that even without setting explicit `boost` and just setting `nodeScopeIndex` 
and `analyzed` to true would improve the search result due to the way 
[Lucene does scoring][boost-faq]. Internally Oak would create separate Lucene 
fields for those jcr properties and would perform a search across all such fields. 
For more details refer to [OAK-3367][OAK-3367]

```
  + indexRules
    - jcr:primaryType = "nt:unstructured"
    + app:Asset
      + properties
        - jcr:primaryType = "nt:unstructured"
        + description
          - nodeScopeIndex = true
          - analyzed = true
          - name = "jcr:content/metadata/jcr:description"
        + title
          - analyzed = true
          - nodeScopeIndex = true
          - name = "jcr:content/metadata/jcr:title"
          - boost = 2.0
```

With above index config a search like

```
SELECT
  *
FROM [app:Asset] 
WHERE 
  CONTAINS(., 'Batman')
```

Would have those node (of type app:Asset) come first where _Batman_ is found in
_jcr:title_. While those nodes where search text is found in other field
like aggregated content would come later

### LuceneIndexProvider Configuration

Some of the runtime aspects of the Oak Lucene support can be configured via OSGi
configuration. The configuration needs to be done for PID `org.apache
.jackrabbit.oak.plugins.index.lucene.LuceneIndexProviderService`

![OSGi Configuration](lucene-osgi-config.png)

enableCopyOnReadSupport
: Enable copying of Lucene index to local file system to improve query 
performance. See [Copy Indexes On Read](#copy-on-read)

enableCopyOnWriteSupport
: Enable copying of Lucene index to local file system to improve indexing 
performance. See [Copy Indexes On Write](#copy-on-write)

localIndexDir
: Directory to be used for when copy index files to local file system. To be 
specified when `enableCopyOnReadSupport` is enabled

prefetchIndexFiles
: Prefetch the index files when CopyOnRead is enabled. When enabled all new Lucene 
index files would be copied locally before the index is made available to 
QueryEngine (1.0.17,1.2.3)

debug
: Boolean value. Defaults to `false`
: If enabled then Lucene logging would be integrated with Slf4j

### Tika Config

`@since Oak 1.0.12, 1.2.3`

Oak Lucene uses [Apache Tika][tika] to extract the text from binary content

    + tika
        - maxExtractLength (long) = -10
        + config.xml  (nt:file)
          + jcr:content
            - jcr:data = //config xml binary content

Oak uses a [default config][default-config]. To use a custom config specify
the config file via `tika/config.xml` node in index config. 

[maxExtractLength][OAK-2470]
: Limits the number of characters that are extracted by the Tika parse. A negative
  value indicates a multiple of `maxFieldLength` and a positive value is used as is
    * maxExtractLength = -10, maxFieldLength = 10000 -> Actual value = 100000
    * maxExtractLength = 1000 -> Actual value = 1000

#### Mime type usage

A binary would only be index if there is an associated property `jcr:mimeType` defined
and that is supported by Tika. By default indexer uses [TypeDetector][OAK-2895]
instead of default `DefaultDetector` which relies on the `jcr:mimeType` to pick up the
right parser. 

<a name="non-root-index"></a>
### Non Root Index Definitions

Lucene index definition can be defined at any location in repository and need
not always be defined at root. For example if your query involves path 
restrictions like

    select * from [app:Asset] as a where ISDESCENDANTNODE(a, '/content/companya') and [format] = 'image'
    
Then you can create the required index definition say `assetIndex` at 
`/content/companya/oak:index/assetIndex`. In such a case that index would 
contain data for the subtree under `/content/companya`

<a name="native-query"></a>
### Native Query and Index Selection

Oak query engine supports native queries like

    //*[rep:native('lucene', 'name:(Hello OR World)')]

If multiple Lucene based indexes are enabled on the system and you need to 
make use of specific Lucene index like `/oak:index/assetIndex` then you can 
specify the index name via `functionName` attribute on index definition. 

For example for assetIndex definition like 

    - jcr:primaryType = "oak:QueryIndexDefinition"
    - type = "lucene"
    ...
    - functionName = "lucene-assetIndex"

Executing following query would ensure that Lucene index from `assetIndex` 
should be used

    //*[rep:native('lucene-assetIndex', 'name:(Hello OR World)')]

### Persisting indexes to FileSystem

By default Lucene indexes are stored in the `NodeStore`. If required they can
be stored on the file system directly

    - jcr:primaryType = "oak:QueryIndexDefinition"
    - type = "lucene"
    ...
    - persistence = "file"
    - path = "/path/to/store/index"

To store the Lucene index in the file system, in the Lucene index definition
node, set the property `persistence` to `file`, and set the property `path` 
to the directory where the index should be stored. Then start reindexing by 
setting `reindex` to `true`.

Note that this setup would only for those non cluster `NodeStore`. If the 
backend `NodeStore` supports clustering then index data would not be 
accessible on other cluster nodes

<a name="copy-on-read"></a>
### CopyOnRead

Lucene indexes are stored in `NodeStore`. Oak Lucene provides a custom directory
implementation which enables Lucene to load index from `NodeStore`. This 
might cause performance degradation if the `NodeStore` storage is remote. For
such case Oak Lucene provide a `CopyOnReadDirectory` which copies the index 
content to a local directory and enables Lucene to make use of local 
directory based indexes while performing queries.

At runtime various details related to copy on read features are exposed via
`CopyOnReadStats` MBean. Indexes at JCR path e.g. `/oak:index/assetIndex` 
would be copied to `<index dir>/<hash of jcr path>`. To determine mapping 
between local index directory and JCR path refer to the MBean details

![CopyOnReadStats](lucene-copy-on-read.png)
  
For more details refer to [OAK-1724][OAK-1724]. This feature can be enabled via
[Lucene Index provider service configuration](#osgi-config)

_With Oak 1.0.13 this feature is now enabled by default._

<a name="copy-on-write"></a>
### CopyOnWrite

`@since Oak 1.0.15, 1.2.3`

Similar to _CopyOnRead_ feature Oak Lucene also supports _CopyOnWrite_ to enable
faster indexing by first buffering the writes to local filesystem and transferring
them to remote storage asynchronously as the indexing proceeds. This should
provide better performance and hence faster indexing times.

**indexPath**

To speed up the indexing with CopyOnWrite you would also need to set `indexPath`
in index definition to the path of index in the repository. For e.g. if your
index is defined at `/oak:index/lucene` then value of `indexPath` should be set 
to `/oak:index/lucene`. This would enable the indexer to perform any read 
during the indexing process locally and thus avoid costly read from remote

For more details refer to [OAK-2247][OAK-2247]. This feature can be enabled via
[Lucene Index provider service configuration](#osgi-config)

### Lucene Index MBeans

Oak Lucene registers a JMX bean `LuceneIndex` which provide details about the 
index content e.g. size of index, number of documents present in index etc

![Lucene Index MBean](lucene-index-mbean.png)

<a name="luke"></a>
### Analyzing created Lucene Index

[Luke]  is a handy development and diagnostic tool, which accesses already 
existing Lucene indexes and allows you to display index details. In Oak 
Lucene index files are stored in `NodeStore` and hence not directly 
accessible. To enable analyzing the index files via Luke follow below 
mentioned steps

1. Download the Luke version which includes the matching Lucene jars used by 
   Oak. As of Oak 1.0.8 release the Lucene version used is 4.7.1. So download
    the jar from [here](https://github.com/DmitryKey/luke/releases)
     
        $wget https://github.com/DmitryKey/luke/releases/download/4.7.0/luke-with-deps.jar
        
2. Use the [Oak Console][oak-console] to dump the Lucene index from `NodeStore`
   to filesystem directory. Use the `lc dump` command
   
        $ java -jar oak-run-*.jar console /path/to/oak/repository
        Apache Jackrabbit Oak 1.1-SNAPSHOT
        Jackrabbit Oak Shell (Apache Jackrabbit Oak 1.1-SNAPSHOT, JVM: 1.7.0_55)
        Type ':help' or ':h' for help.
        -------------------------------------------------------------------------
        /> lc info /oak:index/lucene
        Index size : 74.1 MB
        Number of documents : 235708
        Number of deleted documents : 231
        /> lc 
        dump   info   
        /> lc dump /path/to/dump/index/lucene /oak:index/lucene
        Copying Lucene indexes to [/path/to/dump/index/lucene]
        Copied 74.1 MB in 1.209 s
        /> lc dump /path/to/dump/index/slingAlias /oak:index/slingAlias
        Copying Lucene indexes to [/path/to/dump/index/lucene-index/slingAlias]
        Copied 8.5 MB in 218.7 ms
        />
       
3. Post dump open the index via Luke. Oak Lucene uses a [custom 
   Codec][OAK-1737]. So oak-lucene jar needs to be included in Luke classpath
   for it to display the index details

        $ java -XX:MaxPermSize=512m -cp luke-with-deps.jar:oak-lucene-1.0.8.jar org.getopt.luke.Luke
        
From the Luke UI shown you can access various details.

<a name="text-extraction"></a>
### Pre-Extracting Text from Binaries

`@since Oak 1.0.18, 1.2.3`

Lucene indexing is performed in a single threaded mode. Extracting text from 
binaries is an expensive operation and slows down the indexing rate considerably.
For incremental indexing this mostly works fine but if performing a reindex
or creating the index for the first time after migration then it increases the 
indexing time considerably. 

To speed up the Lucene indexing for such cases i.e. reindexing, we can decouple 
the text extraction from actual indexing. 

1. Extract and store the extracted text from binaries via [oak-run tool][oak-run-tika]
2. Configure a `PreExtractedTextProvider` which can lookup extracted text and 
   thus avoid text extraction at time of actual indexing
   
Below are details around steps required for making using of this feature

1. Generate the csv file containing binary file details

        java -cp tika-app-1.8.jar:oak-run.jar \
        org.apache.jackrabbit.oak.run.Main tika \  
        --fds-path /path/to/datastore \
        --nodestore /path/to/segmentstore --data-file dump.csv generate

2. Extract the text 

        java -cp tika-app-1.8.jar:oak-run.jar \
        org.apache.jackrabbit.oak.run.Main tika \
        --data-file binary-stats.csv \
        --store-path ./store 
        --fds-path /path/to/datastore  extract

3.  Configure the `PreExtractedTextProvider` - Once the extraction is performed 
    configure a `PreExtractedTextProvider` within the application such that Lucene 
    indexer can make use of that to lookup extracted text. 

    For this look for OSGi config for `Apache Jackrabbit Oak DataStore PreExtractedTextProvider`
        
    ![OSGi Configuration](pre-extracted-text-osgi.png)   
   
Once `PreExtractedTextProvider` is configured then upon reindexing Lucene
indexer would make use of it to check if text needs to be extracted or not. Check
`TextExtractionStatsMBean` for various statistics around text extraction and also
to validate if `PreExtractedTextProvider` is being used.

For more details on this feature refer to [OAK-2892][OAK-2892]

### Advanced search features

#### Suggestions

`@since Oak 1.1.17, 1.0.15`

In order to use Lucene index to perform search suggestions, the index definition 
node (the one of type `oak:QueryIndexDefinition`) needs to have the `compatVersion` 
set to `2`, then one or more property nodes, depending on use case, need to have 
the property `useInSuggest` set to `true`, such setting controls from which 
properties terms to be used for suggestions will be taken.
 
Once the above configuration has been done, by default, the Lucene suggester is 
updated every 10 minutes but that can be changed by setting the property 
`suggestUpdateFrequencyMinutes` in the index definition node to a different value.

Sample configuration for suggestions based on terms contained in `jcr:description` 
property.

```
/oak:index/lucene-suggest
  - jcr:primaryType = "oak:QueryIndexDefinition"
  - compatVersion = 2
  - type = "lucene"
  - async = "async"
  - suggestUpdateFrequencyMinutes = 60
  + indexRules
    - jcr:primaryType = "nt:unstructured"
    + nt:base
      + properties
        - jcr:primaryType = "nt:unstructured"
        + jcr:description
          - propertyIndex = true
          - analyzed = true
          - useInSuggest = true
```

`@since Oak 1.3.11` each suggestion would be returned per row.

`@since Oak 1.3.12` the index Analyzer can be used to perform a have more fine grained suggestions, e.g. single words 
(whereas default suggest configuration returns entire property values, see [OAK-3407]: https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/OAK-3407).
Analyzed suggestions can be enabled by setting "suggestAnalyzed" property to true, e.g.:

```
/oak:index/lucene-suggest
  - jcr:primaryType = "oak:QueryIndexDefinition"
  - compatVersion = 2
  - type = "lucene"
  - async = "async"
  - suggestUpdateFrequencyMinutes = 60
  - suggestAnalyzed = true
```


#### Spellchecking

`@since Oak 1.1.17, 1.0.13`

In order to use Lucene index to perform spellchecking, the index definition node 
(the one of type `oak:QueryIndexDefinition`) needs to have the `compatVersion` 
set to `2`, then one or more property nodes, depending on use case, need to have 
the property `useInSpellcheck` set to `true`, such setting controls from which 
properties terms to be used for spellcheck corrections will be taken.
 
Sample configuration for spellchecking based on terms contained in `jcr:title` 
property.

Since Oak 1.3.11, the each suggestion would be returned per row.

```
/oak:index/lucene-spellcheck
  - jcr:primaryType = "oak:QueryIndexDefinition"
  - compatVersion = 2
  - type = "lucene"
  - async = "async"
  + indexRules
    - jcr:primaryType = "nt:unstructured"
    + nt:base
      + properties
        - jcr:primaryType = "nt:unstructured"
        + jcr:title
          - propertyIndex = true
          - analyzed = true
          - useInSpellcheck = true
```

### Design Considerations

Lucene index provides quite a few features to meet various query requirements. 
While defining the index definition do consider the following aspects

1.  If query uses different path restrictions keeping other restrictions 
    same then make use of `evaluatePathRestrictions`
   
2.  If query performs sorting then have an explicit property definition for
    the property on which sorting is being performed and set `ordered` to true 
    for that property
   
3.  If the query is based on specific nodeType then define `indexRules` for that
    nodeType
   
4.  Aim for a precise index configuration which indexes just the right amount of content
    based on your query requirement. An index which is precise would be smaller and 
    would perform better.
   
5.  **Make use of nodetype to achieve a _cohesive_ index**. This would allow multiple
    queries to make use of same index and also evaluation of multiple property 
    restrictions natively in Lucene

6.  **[Non root indexes](#non-root-index)** - If your query always
    perform search under certain paths then create index definition under those
    paths only. This might be helpful in multi tenant deployment where each tenant
    data is stored under specific repository path and all queries are made under
    those path.   

    In fact its recommended to use single index if all the properties being indexed
    are related. This would enable Lucene index to evaluate as much property
    restriction as possible  natively (which is faster) and also save on storage
    cost incurred in storing the node path.
   
7.  Use features when required - There are certain features provided by Lucene
    index  which incur extra cost in terms of storage space when enabled. For
    example enabling `evaluatePathRestrictions`, `ordering` etc. Enable such
    option only when you make use of those features and further enable them for
    only those properties. So `ordering`  should be enabled only when sorting is
    being performed for those properties and `evaluatePathRestrictions` should
    only be enabled if you are going to specify path restrictions.
   
Following analogy might be helpful to people coming from RDBMS world. Treat your
nodetype as Table in your DB and all the direct or relative properties as columns
in that table. Various property definitions can then be considered as index for 
those columns. 

### Lucene Index vs Property Index

Lucene based index can be restricted to index only specific properties and in that
case it is similar to [Property Index](query.html#property-index). However it differs
from property index in following aspects

1.  Lucene index is Asynchronous - Lucene indexing is done asynchronously with a default
    interval of 5 secs. If there are lots of writes and those writes are related to what
    is being indexed then it might cause further delay. Compared to this the property index
    are always synchronous and upto date.

    So if in your usecase you need the latest result then prefer _Property Indexes_ over
    _Lucene Index_

2.  Lucene index cannot enforce uniqueness constraint - By virtue of it being asynchronous
    it cannot enforce uniqueness constraint.

### Examples

#### A - Simple queries

In many cases the query is purely based on some specific property and is not 
restricted to any specific nodeType

```
SELECT
  *
FROM [nt:base] AS s
WHERE ISDESCENDANTNODE([/content/public/platform])
AND s.code = 'DRAFT'
```

Following index definition would allow using Lucene index for above query

```
/oak:index/assetType
  - jcr:primaryType = "oak:QueryIndexDefinition"
  - compatVersion = 2
  - type = "lucene"
  - async = "async"
  - evaluatePathRestrictions = true
  + indexRules
    - jcr:primaryType = "nt:unstructured"
    + nt:base
      + properties
        - jcr:primaryType = "nt:unstructured"
        + code
          - propertyIndex = true
          - name = "code"
```

Above definition

* Indexes `code` property present on any node
* Supports evaluation of path restriction i.e. `ISDESCENDANTNODE([/content/public/platform])`
  via `evaluatePathRestrictions`
* Has a single indexRule for `nt:base` as queries do not specify any explicit
  nodeType restriction
  
Now you have another query like 
```
SELECT
  *
FROM [nt:base] AS s
WHERE 
  s.status = 'DONE'
```

Here we can either add another property to the above definition or create a new 
index definition altogether. By default prefer to club such indexes together

```
/oak:index/assetType
  - jcr:primaryType = "oak:QueryIndexDefinition"
  - compatVersion = 2
  - type = "lucene"
  - async = "async"
  - evaluatePathRestrictions = true
  + indexRules
    - jcr:primaryType = "nt:unstructured"
    + nt:base
      + properties
        - jcr:primaryType = "nt:unstructured"
        + code
          - propertyIndex = true
          - name = "code"
        + status
          - propertyIndex = true
          - name = "status"
```

Taking another example. Lets say you perform a range query like

```
SELECT
  [jcr:path],
  [jcr:score],
  *
FROM [nt:base] AS a
WHERE isdescendantnode(a, '/content')
AND [offTime] > CAST('2015-04-06T02:28:33.032-05:00' AS date)
```

This can also be clubbed in same index definition above

```
/oak:index/assetType
  - jcr:primaryType = "oak:QueryIndexDefinition"
  - compatVersion = 2
  - type = "lucene"
  - async = "async"
  - evaluatePathRestrictions = true
  + indexRules
    - jcr:primaryType = "nt:unstructured"
    + nt:base
      + properties
        - jcr:primaryType = "nt:unstructured"
        + code
          - propertyIndex = true
          - name = "code"
        + status
          - propertyIndex = true
          - name = "status"
        + offTime
          - propertyIndex = true
          - name = "offTime"
```

#### B - Queries for structured content

Queries in previous examples were based on mostly unstructured content where no
nodeType restrictions were applied. However in many cases the nodes being queried
confirm to certain structure. For example you have following content

```
/content/dam/assets/december/banner.png
  - jcr:primaryType = "app:Asset"
  + jcr:content
    - jcr:primaryType = "app:AssetContent"
    + metadata
      - dc:format = "image/png"
      - status = "published"
      - jcr:lastModified = "2009-10-9T21:52:31"
      - app:tags = ["properties:orientation/landscape", "marketing:interest/product"]
      - size = 450
      - comment = "Image for december launch"
      - jcr:title = "December Banner"
      + xmpMM:History
        + 1
          - softwareAgent = "Adobe Photoshop"
          - author = "David"
    + renditions (nt:folder)
      + original (nt:file)
        + jcr:content
          - jcr:data = ...
```

Content like above is then queried in multiple ways. So lets take first query

**UC1 - Find all assets which are having `status` as `published`**

```
SELECT
  *
FROM [app:Asset] AS a
WHERE 
  a.[jcr:content/metadata/status] = 'published'
```

For this following index definition would be have to be created

```
/oak:index/assetType
  - jcr:primaryType = "oak:QueryIndexDefinition"
  - compatVersion = 2
  - type = "lucene"
  - async = "async"
  + indexRules
    - jcr:primaryType = "nt:unstructured"
    + app:Asset
      + properties
        - jcr:primaryType = "nt:unstructured"
        + status
          - propertyIndex = true
          - name = "jcr:content/metadata/status"
```

Above index definition

* Indexes all nodes of type `app:Asset` **only**
* Indexes relative property `jcr:content/metadata/status` for all such nodes

**UC2 - Find all assets which are having `status` as `published` sorted by last 
modified date**

```
SELECT
  *
FROM [app:Asset] AS a
WHERE 
  a.[jcr:content/metadata/status] = 'published'
ORDER BY
  a.[jcr:content/metadata/jcr:lastModified] DESC
```

To enable above query the index definition needs to be updated to following

```
    + app:Asset
      + properties
        - jcr:primaryType = "nt:unstructured"
        + status
          - propertyIndex = true
          - name = "jcr:content/metadata/status"        
        + lastModified
          - propertyIndex = true
          - name = "jcr:content/metadata/jcr:lastModified"
          - ordered = true
          - type = Date
```

Above index definition

* `jcr:content/metadata/jcr:lastModified` is marked as **`ordered`** enabling 
  support _order by_ evaluation i.e. sorting for such properties
* Property type is set to `Date`
* Indexes both `status` and `jcr:lastModified`

**UC3 - Find all assets where comment contains _december_**

```
SELECT
  *
FROM [app:Asset] 
WHERE 
  CONTAINS([jcr:content/metadata/comment], 'december')
```

To enable above query the index definition needs to be updated to following

```
    + app:Asset
      + properties
        - jcr:primaryType = "nt:unstructured"
        + comment
          - name = "jcr:content/metadata/comment"
          - analyzed = true
```

Above index definition

* `jcr:content/metadata/comment` is marked as **`analyzed`** enabling 
  evaluation of `contains` i.e. fulltext search
* `propertyIndex` is not enabled as this property is not going to be used to
  perform equality check

**UC4 - Find all assets which are created by David and refer to december **

```
SELECT
  *
FROM [app:Asset] 
WHERE 
  CONTAINS(., 'december david')
```

Here we want to create a fulltext index for all assets. It would index all the 
properties in `app:Asset` including all relative nodes. To enable that we need to
make use of [aggregation](#aggregation)

```
/oak:index/assetType
  - jcr:primaryType = "oak:QueryIndexDefinition"
  - compatVersion = 2
  - type = "lucene"
  - async = "async"
  + aggregates
    + app:Asset
      + include0
        - path = "jcr:content"
      + include1
        - path = "jcr:content/metadata"      
      + include2
        - path = "jcr:content/metadata/*"
      + include3
        - path = "jcr:content/metadata/*/*"        
      + include4
        - path = "jcr:content/renditions"
      + include5
        - path = "jcr:content/renditions/original" 
    + nt:file
      + include0
        - path = "jcr:content"
  + indexRules
    - jcr:primaryType = "nt:unstructured"
    + app:Asset
      - includePropertyTypes = ["String", "Binary"]
      + properties
        - jcr:primaryType = "nt:unstructured"
        + comment
          - propertyIndex = true
          - nodeScopeIndex = true
          - name = "jcr:content/metadata/comment"
```

Above index definition

*   Only indexes `String` and `Binary` properties as part of fulltext index via
    **`includePropertyTypes`**
   
*   Has `aggregates` defined for various relative paths like _jcr:content_,
    _jcr:content/metadata_, _jcr:content/renditions/original_ etc. 
  
    With these rules properties like _banner.png/metadata/comment_,
    _banner.png/metadata/xmpMM:History/1/author_ get indexed as part for fulltext
    index for _banner.png_ node.
    
*   Inclusion of _jcr:content/renditions/original_ would lead to aggregation of
    _jcr:content/renditions/original/jcr:content/jcr:data_ property also as 
    aggregation logic would apply rules for `nt:file` while aggregating the 
    `original` node
    
*   Aggregation would include by default all properties which are part of
    **`includePropertyTypes`**. However if any property has a explicit property
    definition provided like `comment` then `nodeScopeIndex` would need to be 
    set to true

Above definition would allow fulltext query to be performed. But we can do more.
Suppose you want to give more preference to those nodes where the fulltext term
is found in `jcr:title` compared to any other field. In such cases we can `boost` 
such fields 

```
  + indexRules
    - jcr:primaryType = "nt:unstructured"
    + app:Asset
      + properties
        - jcr:primaryType = "nt:unstructured"
        + comment
          - propertyIndex = true
          - nodeScopeIndex = true
          - name = "jcr:content/metadata/comment"
        + title
          - propertyIndex = true
          - nodeScopeIndex = true
          - name = "jcr:content/metadata/jcr:title"
          - boost = 2.0
```
