## Elastic Index

Oak supports Elasticsearch (Elastic for short) based indexes for both property constraint and full text constraints. 
Elastic indexes support similar features as [Lucene][lucene] indexes, 
however there are differences:

* The `type` is `elasticsearch`.
* The index definition needs to be under `/oak:index`.
  Other locations are not supported.
* The `async` property needs to be set to `elastic-async`. 
  Synchronous, `nrt` or other lanes are not supported.
  Indexes are updated asynchronously.
* `refresh` is ignored.
  Changes take effect immediately after changing them.
  Existing documents in Elasticsearch are not changed.
* Indexes are NOT automatically built when needed: 
  They can be built by setting the `reindex` property to `true` or by using the `oak-run` tool.
  We recommend to build them using the `oak-run` tool.
* `codec` is ignored.
* `compatVersion` is ignored.
* `useIfExists` is ignored.
* `blobSize` is ignored.
* `functionName` is ignored.
* `name` is ignored.
* `indexPath` is ignored.
* `analyzers` is ignored.
* For property definitions, `sync` and `unique` are ignored.
* The behavior for `dynamicBoost` is slightly different: 
  For Lucene indexes, boosting is done in indexing, while for Elastic it is done at query time.
