### Reporting Vulnerabilities with Apache Jackrabbit Oak

The Apache Software Foundation takes an active stance in eliminating security problems. We strongly encourage everyone 
to report vulnerabilities to the Apache security mailing list _security(at)apache.org_, before disclosing them in a public forum.

Please note that the security mailing list should only be used for reporting undisclosed vulnerabilities and 
managing the process of fixing them. We cannot accept regular bug reports or other queries at this address. If you wish 
to report a bug that isn't an undisclosed security vulnerability, please use [https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/OAK/issues](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/OAK/issues).

###Errors and Omissions

Please report any errors or omissions to _security(at)apache.org_.
