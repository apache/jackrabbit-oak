Permissions vs Privileges
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### General Notes

Usually it is not required for a application to check the privileges/permissions
of a given session (or set of principals) as this evaluation can be left
to the repository.

For rare cases where the application needs to understand if a given session is 
actually allowed to perform a given action, it is recommend to use `Session.hasPermission(String, String)`
or `JackrabbitSession.hasPermission(String, String...)`

In order to test permissions that are not reflected in the action constants
defined on `Session` or `JackrabbitSession`, the default implementation also allows
to pass the names of the Oak internal permission. 

To evaluate privileges granted for a given editing session `AccessControlManager.hasPrivileges(String, Privilege[])`,
`AccessControlManager.getPrivileges(String)` can be used. The `JackrabbitAccessControlManager` defines variants of both 
methods that in addition take a set of `Principal`. If the editing session as sufficient permissions these methods can 
be used to  evaluate/obtain privileges for a different set of principals than associated with the editing session.

Since Oak 1.42.0 `JackrabbitAccessControlManager` defines `JackrabbitAccessControlManager.getPrivilegeCollection(String)`
and `JackrabbitAccessControlManager.getPrivilegeCollection(String, Set)` which allows for efficient evaluation if a given set 
of privileges are granted at a given path. It allows to avoid repeated calls to `hasPrivileges` for the same path or 
manual resolution of privilege aggregation (see  [OAK-9494](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/OAK-9494) 
for details).

The subtle differences between the permission-testing `Session`  and the evaluation
of privileges on `AccessControlManager` are listed below.

### Testing Permissions

#### Variants

- `Session.hasPermission(String absPath, String actions)`
- `Session.checkPermission(String absPath, String actions)`
- `JackrabbitSession.hasPermission(String absPath, @Nonnull String... actions)`

Where

- `absPath` is an absolute path pointing to an existing or non-existing item (node or property)
- `actions` defines a comma-separated string (or string array respectively) of the actions defined on `Session` and `JackrabbitSession` (see below). 
  With the default implementation also Oak internal permission names are allowed ( _Note:_ permission names != privilege names)
  
See section [Permissions](../permission.html#oak_permissions) for a comprehensive
list and the mapping from actions to permissions.

#### Characteristics

- API call always supported even if access control management is not part of the feature set (see corresponding repository descriptor).
- _Note:_ `ACTION_ADD_NODE` is evaluating if the node at the specified absPath can be added; i.e. the path points to the non-existing node you want to add
- Not possible to evaluate custom privileges with this method as those are not respected by the default permission evaluation.
- Restrictions will be respected as possible with the given (limited) information 


### Testing Privileges

#### Variants

- `AccessControlManager.hasPrivileges(String absPath, Privilege[] privileges)`
- `AccessControlManager.getPrivileges(String absPath)`
- `JackrabbitAccessControlManager.getPrivilegeCollection(String absPath)` followed by `PrivilegeCollection.includes(String...)`

Where

- `absPath` must point to an existing Node (i.e. existing and accessible to the editing session)
- `privileges` represent an array of supported privileges (see corresponding API calls)

For testing purpose the Jackrabbit extension further allows to verify the privileges 
granted to a given combination of principals, which may or may not reflect the actual 
principal-set assigned to a given `Subject`. These calls (see below) however
requires the ability to read access control content on the target path.

- `JackrabbitAccessControlManager.hasPrivileges(String absPath, Set<Principal> principals, Privilege[] privileges)`
- `JackrabbitAccessControlManager.getPrivileges(String absPath, Set<Principal> principals)`
- `JackrabbitAccessControlManager.getPrivilegeCollection(String absPath, Set<Principal> principals)` (see also section [Privilege Management](../privilege.html))

#### Characteristics

- Only available if access control management is part of the supported feature set of the JCR repository.
- Built-in and/or custom privileges can be tested
- `jcr:addChildNode` evaluates if any child can be added at the parent node identify by the specified absPath. The name of child is not known here! 
- Restrictions may or may not be respected
- Default implementation close to real permission evaluation (not exactly following the specification)
