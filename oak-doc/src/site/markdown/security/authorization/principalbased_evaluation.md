Permission Evaluation with Principal-Based Authorization
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The examples below describe permission evaluation based on an authorization setup with the following characteristices:
   
    FilterProviderImpl:
        - Path: "/home/users/system/supported"

    CompositeAuthorizationConfiguration (CompositionType=AND): 
       
        PrincipalBasedAuthorizationConfiguration
        - FilterProvider: reference to FilterProviderImpl as configured above (default implementation)
        - Enable AggregationFilter: true
        - Ranking: 500
        
        AuthorizationConfigurationImpl
        - Ranking: 100
 
The following principals will be used in various combinations:
 
    Principals not supported by the configured 'FilterProvider'
    
    - GroupPrincipal:      'testgroup'        
    - Principal:           'user'        
    - SystemUserPrincipal: 'service-A' with path /home/users/system/45
    
    Principals supporeted by the configured 'FilterProvider'
    
    - SystemUserPrincipal: 'service-B' with path /home/users/system/supported/featureB/11
    - SystemUserPrincipal: 'service-C' with path /home/users/system/supported/featureC/C1
    
The following access control setup has been defined:
 
    grant access using regular path-based ac-management calls 
    i.e. 'AccessControlManager.getApplicablePolicies(String)' or 'AccessControlManager.getPolicies(String))'
    
    - 'testgroup': /content [jcr:read, jcr:readAccessControl]
    - 'service-A': /content [jcr:versionManagement]
    - 'service-B': /content [jcr:read, jcr:modifyProperties]
    
    grant access using principal-based ac-management calls (only possible for supported principals)
    i.e. 'JackrabbitAccessControlManager.getApplicablePolicies(Principal)' or 'AccessControlManager.getPolicies(Principal))'
    
    - 'service-B': /content [jcr:read, jcr:nodeTypeManagement]
    - 'service-C': /content [jcr:read, jcr:lockManagement]
                   
##### Example 1: Subject with principals _'user'_, _'testgroup'_
Since neither 'user' nor 'testgroup' is a system-user-princial supported by principal-based authorization, 
principal-based permission evaluation is omitted.

Result: the Session is granted `jcr:read`, `jcr:readAccessControl` at /content.
 
##### Example 2: Subject with principals _'service-A'_, _'testgroup'_
Since neither 'service-A' nor 'testgroup' is supported by principal-based authorization, 
principal-based permission evaluation is omitted.

Result: the Session is granted `jcr:read`, `jcr:readAccessControl`, `jcr:versionManagement` at /content.
 
##### Example 3: Subject with principals _'service-B'_, _'testgroup'_
Since 'testgroup' is not supported by principal-based authorization, principal-based permission evaluation is omitted 
and only path-based access control setup take effect.

Result: the Session is granted `jcr:read`,`jcr:readAccessControl`,`jcr:modifyProperties` at /content.
 
##### Example 4: Subject with principals _'service-A'_, _'service-B'_
Since 'service-A' is not supported by principal-based authorization, principal-based permission evaluation is omitted 
and only path-based access control setup take effect.

Result: the Session is granted `jcr:read`,`jcr:modifyProperties`,`jcr:versionManagement` at /content.
 
##### Example 5: Subject with principals _'service-B'_
'service-B' is supported by principal-based authorization and no unsupported principal is present in the Subject.
Therefore, principal-based permission evaluation takes effect. Since the `AggregationFilter` is enabled in the configuration 
describedf above, permission evaluation stops and does not continue evaluating path-based permissions.

Result: the Session is granted `jcr:read`, `jcr:nodeTypeManagement` at /content.

NOTE: 
If `AggregationFilter` was disabled _both_ permission providers would be used for the evaluation. 
The result then depends on the `CompositionType`:

| `AggregationFilter` | `CompositionType.AND` | `CompositionType.OR` |
|---------------------|-----------------------|----------------------|
| enabled           | `jcr:read`, `jcr:nodeTypeManagement` | `jcr:read`, `jcr:nodeTypeManagement` |
| disabled          | `jcr:read`          | `jcr:read`, `jcr:modifyProperties`, `jcr:nodeTypeManagement` |
 
##### Example 6: Subject with principals _'service-C'_
'service-C' is supported by principal-based authorization and no unsupported principal is present in the Subject.
Therefore, principal-based permission evaluation takes effect. Since the `AggregationFilter` is enabled in the configuration
described above, permission evaluation stops and does not continue evaluating path-based permissions.

Result: the Session is granted `jcr:read`, `jcr:lockManagement` at /content.

NOTE: 
If `AggregationFilter` was disabled _both_ permission providers would be used for the evaluation. 
The result then depends on the `CompositionType`:

| `AggregationFilter` | `CompositionType.AND` | `CompositionType.OR` |
|---------------------|-----------------------|----------------------|
| enabled           | `jcr:read`, `jcr:lockManagement` | `jcr:read`, `jcr:lockManagement` |
| disabled          | -                   | `jcr:read`, `jcr:lockManagement` |
 
##### Example 6: Subject with principals _'service-B'_, _'service-C'_
Both 'service-B' is supported by principal-based authorization and no unsupported principal is present in the Subject.
Therefore, principal-based permission evaluation takes effect. Since the `AggregationFilter` is enabled in the configuration
described above, permission evaluation stops and does not continue evaluating path-based permissions.

Result: the Session is granted `jcr:read`, `jcr:nodeTypeManagement`, `jcr:lockManagement` at /content.

NOTE: 
If `AggregationFilter` was disabled _both_ permission providers would be used for the evaluation. 
The result then depends on the `CompositionType`:

| `AggregationFilter` | `CompositionType.AND` | `CompositionType.OR` |
|---------------------|-----------------------|----------------------|
| enabled           | `jcr:read`, `jcr:nodeTypeManagement`, `jcr:lockManagement` | `jcr:read`, `jcr:nodeTypeManagement`, `jcr:lockManagement` |
| disabled          | `jcr:read`          | `jcr:read`, `jcr:modifyProperties`, `jcr:nodeTypeManagement`, `jcr:lockManagement` |
