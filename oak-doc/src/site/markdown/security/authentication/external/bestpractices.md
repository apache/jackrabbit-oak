# Best Practices for External Authentication

<!-- MACRO{toc} -->

## Before you get started

Before you get started make sure you are familiar with the basic concepts of JCR authentication, and
its implementation in Apache Jackrabbit Oak.

External authentication in Oak refers to integrating a third party identity provider like LDAP or
SAML into the authentication setup optionally combining it with other built-in authentication
mechanisms.

## Best Practices

### JAAS Setup

When combining external authentication with other built-in or custom [login modules] make sure to
define a [configuration] with the optimal order and the proper [control flag] for each module to
cover all cases. The order should be chosen such that optional and sufficient login modules come
first. Potentially expensive authentication against a third party identity provider as well as those
for rare use cases should be defined with a lower ranking.

#### Combination with Token Authentication

Whenever JCR sessions created with Oak are short-lived (e.g. only lasting for a single HTTP request)
authentication against an external IDP may not perform well. It is therefore recommended to use
external authentication in combination with an additional authentication mechanism like e.g. the
built-in [token login](../tokenmanagement.html).

Make sure the token login module has [control flag] 'SUFFICIENT' and is evaluated prior to the
external login that connects to the external IDP.

#### Combination with Default Authentication

Oak comes with a default login for user accounts stored and managed inside the JCR content
repository. This also includes support for default users like 'anonymous' (guest) and 'admin' with
full access to the repository. If this is desired, it is recommend to also add
the [default `LoginModule`](../default.html#uid_pw) to the JAAS configuration.

The optional order depends on the frequency of default vs external login: if login or impersonation
against local users occurs frequently (e.g. unauthentication login with [GuestCredentials]) the
default login module should have a higher ranking. However, if authentication of local users is
unlikely, the external oak login should have a ranking.

##### Example JAAS Configuration

The following JAAS configuration is an example when running an Oak repository with external
authentication in combination with Apache Sling:

| Ranking | Control Flag | LoginModule Class Name                                                                         |
|---------|--------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 300     | OPTIONAL     | org.apache.jackrabbit.oak.spi.security.authentication.GuestLoginModule                         |
| 200     | SUFFICIENT   | org.apache.jackrabbit.oak.security.authentication.token.TokenLoginModule                       | 
| 150     | SUFFICIENT   | org.apache.jackrabbit.oak.spi.security.authentication.external.impl.ExternalLoginModuleFactory |
| 100     | SUFFICIENT   | org.apache.jackrabbit.oak.security.authentication.user.LoginModuleImpl                         |

See [Authentication with External Login Module : Examples](externallogin_examples.html#Integration_with_Standard_Oak_Authentication_used_for_Apache_Sling)
for a detailed explanation as well as alternative
configurations.

### Synchronization of Users and Groups

The external authentication module in Oak comes with the option to synchronize external identities
into the content repository (see section [User and Group Synchronization](../usersync.html)).

The following best practices should be followed:

#### External Identity Provider as SSOT

Your external identity provider should be considered the single source of truth (SSOT) for all users
and groups defined and managed by it.

In contrast, the users/groups synchronized into the repository should be considered a volatile cache
and ideally are immutable (i.e. only maintained by system sessions in charge of the
synchronization).

The following features provided by the _oak-auth-external_ module help to prevent unintended
modification of synchronized external identities:

- [Dynamic Membership](defaultusersync.html#dynamic_membership): Enabling dynamic membership will
  result in membership information being stored in a protected property that cannot be altered using
  regular JCR write or Jackrabbit user management API.
- [Dynamic Group](defaultusersync.html#dynamic_groups): Can be used in combination with dynamic
  membership when the application requires group principals to also exposed through `UserManager` (
  and not just through `PrincipalManager` as it would be needed for permission setup). Note though
  that these group accounts cannot have members added (see
  section [Enforcing dynamic groups](defaultusersync.html#enforcing_dynamic_groups))
- [Protecting External Identities](defaultusersync.html#protect_external_identities): The module
  comes with [configuration
  option](defaultusersync.html#configuration_principals) to protect external identities. If
  enabled (as warning or as full protection) a dedicated validator that will report/fail attempts to
  modify synchronized external identities. This will help to identify violations of the immutability
  contract.

#### User Management for External Identities

- Properties and membership for external identities must be managed in the external IDP. Changes
  made in the JCR repository using user management API will be overwritten upon the next sync.
- Never set a password for external users to make sure uid/pw login gets authenticated against the
  external IDP and never against the synchronized user in the repository.

#### Membership Nesting

For performance reasons avoid defining unnecessary membership nesting that increase the number of
indirections (see [Best Practices for Authorization](../../authorization/bestpractices.html)).

#### Membership crossing IDP boundaries

Introducing membership crossing IDP boundaries should be considered a trust boundary violation.

If adding external identities to local groups cannot be avoided,
leverage [conditional auto-membership](defaultusersync.html#configuration_automembership) or
auto-membership configuration in combination with dynamic membership (
see [Configuration of the DefaultSyncHandler](defaultusersync.html#configuration_sync_handler)).

### Authorization for External Identities

Upon repository login through external authentication the subject is populated with principals
obtained from the external identity provider.

In addition, the configured auto-membership will be resolved for the external user and its external
groups (see autoMembership configuration [options](defaultusersync.html#configuration_sync_handler)
and
section [Automatic Membership with AutoMembershipConfig](defaultusersync.html#configuration_automembership))

The authenticated session will be subject to regular Oak permission evaluation as defined for the
instance and described in section [Permissions](../../permission.html).

#### Access control setup

Synchronized external identities (both in default and in dynamic sync mode) are exposed as
principals through the [Principal Management API](../../principal.html) and can be used for access
control setup as described in [Access Control Management](../../accesscontrol.html).

See also section [Best Practices for Authorization](../../authorization/bestpractices.html) for
recommendations.

External groups get synchronized together with external users upon repository login. If you wish to
defined access control setup for groups prior to the synchronization upon login the following 2
options exist:

- Pre-sync external groups to make them available to the principal manager (see next section)
- Configure [ImportMode](../../accesscontrol/default.html#configuration)=`besteffort` with the
  default Oak authorization setup and define access control content for principals before they
  exist (see below).

##### Pre-sync of external groups

The following 2 options exist to populate the repository with external group principals outside the
regular synchronization upon login:

- The _oak-auth-external_ module comes with a JMX integration that allows for synchronization of
  external identities outside the regular repository login.
  See [JMX Synchronization Tool](../usersync.html#jmx-synchronization-tool)
  and [SynchronizationMBean](https://jackrabbit.apache.org/oak/docs/apidocs/org/apache/jackrabbit/oak/spi/security/authentication/external/impl/jmx/SynchronizationMBean.html)
  for details. This requires the `ExternalIdentityProvider` to implement the methods required to
  retrieve external identities. This is the recommended way to pre-sync groups.
- In case the `ExternalIdentityProvider` does not support user and group sync outside the regular
  repository login, external identities can be created using Jackrabbit User Management API. Note:
    - The property `rep:externalId` is system maintained and protected and cannot be added or
      changed once the group has been persisted.
    - Mistakes in defining the protected properties `rep:externalId`, `rep:authorizableId`
      or `rep:principalName` will result in a mismatch during authentication, sync and permission
      evaluation. The only way to fix such mistakes is to remove and recreate the group. Access
      control content associated with a wrong principal name needs to be removed separately.

##### Define Access Control Setup for Non-Existing Principals

While JSR 283 mandates that an `AccessControlException` is thrown whenever the principal specified
for any access control content does not exist, Apache Jackrabbit Oak allows for a relaxed contract
using configuration option [ImportMode](../../accesscontrol/default.html#xml_import). If set
to [`besteffort`](../../accesscontrol/default.html#configuration) access control setup for unknown
principals can be created.

See also [SLING-12115](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SLING-12115) for an additional option
with [Apache Sling RepoInit](https://sling.apache.org/documentation/bundles/repository-initialization.html)
to define create access control entries for non-existing principals.
