# Runnable jar

Oak comes with
a [runnable jar](https://github.com/apache/jackrabbit-oak/blob/trunk/oak-run/README.md),
which contains everything you need for a simple Oak installation.

# Using Oak in your project

To use Oak in your project simply add a dependency to `org.apache.jackrabbit:oak-jcr:1.0.0` and to
`javax.jcr:jcr:2.0`:

    <dependency>
      <groupId>org.apache.jackrabbit</groupId>
      <artifactId>oak-jcr</artifactId>
      <version>1.0.0</version>
    </dependency>
    <dependency>
      <groupId>javax.jcr</groupId>
      <artifactId>jcr</artifactId>
      <version>2.0</version>
    </dependency>

Oak has simple mechanisms for constructing and configuring content repositories
for use in embedded deployments and test cases:

* [Repository construction](construct.html)
* [Configuring Oak](osgi_config.html)
