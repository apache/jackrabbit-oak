I like to move it
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This page describes how move operations are implemented in Oak and highlights
some of the interesting and potentially surprising side effects it has on memory
usage.

JCR `Node` and Oak `Tree` instances are basic entities how to access
content in a repository. In Jackrabbit Oak the implementation of a JCR `Node` is
backed by a `MutableTree` that implements `Tree`. As the name indicates this
`Tree` is mutable and its state can change over time. The following example
illustrates this.

    ContentSession s = ...
    Root r = s.getLatestRoot();
    Tree t = r.getTree("/zoo/marty");
    r.move("/zoo/marty", "/madagascar/marty");
    String p = t.getPath();

Even though the move operation was not invoked on the `Tree` `t` directly, the
change will be reflected in the value returned by `t.getPath()`. The returned
path will be `/madagascar/marty`.

The impact of a move operation on a `Tree` instance is evaluated lazily. The
main benefit of this approach is that we don't need to spend time to update
`Tree` instances unnecessarily when they are referenced by the heap, but not
used by the application and later garbage collected.

So, how are move operations applied lazily to `Tree` instances? Each
`MutableTree` object has a `pendingMoves` reference to the next `Move` it
needs to apply before any read or write operation. Reading a child `Tree` passes
on the current `pendingMoves` reference to the child. That is, while reading an
entire subtree, all `MutableTree` instances will have a `pendingMoves` reference
pointing to the same `Move`. Initially, the referenced `Move` will be empty,
which indicates no move operation happened.

Going back to the example. A slightly simplified state before the move operation
looks like the following.

![Tree before move](tree-before-move.png)

Right after the move operation, the state of `MutableTree` instances are still
the same. Only the `Move` object referenced by them was modified with information
about the move operation and a new empty `Move` object appended via the `next`
reference.

![Tree after move](tree-after-move.png)

The effect of a move operation on `Tree` objects is applied when a `Tree`
is accessed, e.g. by calling `getPath()`. Whenever a read or write happens, a
`MutableTree` will check if there is anything to do via `pendingMoves` and apply
an operation when the source path of the move matches its own path. A `MutableTree`
simply moves on to the next `Move` if the source path does not match, until an empty
`Move` is reached. This entire process is also done recursively by first applying any
potential move operations on the parent. This ensures hierarchical integrity when
a subtree is moved.

![Tree access after move](tree-access-after-move.png)

After this read operation the `Move` object with the source and destination
information is not referenced anymore by any `MutableTree`, and it is eligible
for garbage collection.

This implementation has drawbacks for some usage patterns. A `MutableTree`
obtained from a `ContentSession` and referenced by the application can retain
significant memory when the tree is not accessed while move operations are
performed with the same `ContentSession`.

Let's consider an example where Julien stays at the zoo, while the others move
to Madagascar.

    Tree zoo = r.getTree("/zoo");
    Tree madagascar = r.getTree("/madagascar");
    Tree julien = zoo.getChild("julien");
    List<Tree> move = StreamSupport.stream(target.getChildren().spliterator(), false)
            .filter(t -> !t.getName().equals(julien.getName()))
            .collect(Collectors.toList());
    move.forEach(t -> r.move(t.getPath(), concat(madagascar.getPath(), t.getName())));
    move.forEach(t -> System.out.println(t.getName() + " made it to Madagascar"));

At the end the `Tree` `julien` will have accumulated move information, while all
`Tree` instances in the `List` have `pendingMoves` pointing to the empty `Move`.
Please note, memory retained by julien is independent of whether changes are
committed or not through `ContentSession.commit()`. The linked `Move` objects
referenced by `pendingMoves` are the same. Intuition might suggest committing
changes frees memory, but it is not the case in this scenario.

![Tree after many moves](tree-after-many-moves.png)

Memory usage in this situation is significant because a `Move` object not just
remembers path information but actually references a `MutableTree`
object as the destination parent and a `String` for the name of the moved tree
under the new parent. Behind the scenes, a `MutableTree` also references its parent
and a `NodeBuilder` to access properties. This also means, moving nodes deep
down will use more memory compared to nodes closer to the root.

It is therefore advisable to release references to `Tree` instances as soon as
possible in code that performs many move operations. Alternatively, code should
call a method once in a while on a `Tree` it references for a longer period of
time.
