Getting Started
---------------

Many parts of Oak are still under construction, so it may be a bit difficult to find your way around
the codebase. The [README files](https://github.com/apache/jackrabbit-oak/blob/trunk/README.md),
this documentation, and the [Oak mailing list](http://oak.markmail.org/) archives are good places
to start learning about Oak.

There is also the [Jackrabbit 3 wiki page](http://wiki.apache.org/jackrabbit/Jackrabbit%203), which
is mostly outdated though and should only be consulted for historical research.

To get started developing Oak, checkout the sources from [svn](https://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/jackrabbit/oak/trunk), 
or [fork them](https://github.com/apache/jackrabbit-oak) on GitHub. Then build the latest sources with Maven 3 and 
Java 7 (or higher) like this:

    mvn clean install

To enable all integration tests, including the JCR TCK, use:

    mvn clean install -PintegrationTesting

Before committing changes or submitting a patch, please make sure that the above integration testing
build passes without errors. If you like, you can enable integration tests by default by setting the
`OAK_INTEGRATION_TESTING` environment variable.

MongoDB integration
-------------------

Parts of the Oak build expects a MongoDB instance to be available for testing. By default a MongoDB
instance running on localhost is expected, and the relevant tests are simply skipped if such an
instance is not found. You can also configure the build to use custom MongoDB settings with the
following properties (shown with their default values):

    -Dmongo.host=127.0.0.1
    -Dmongo.port=27017
    -Dmongo.db=MongoMKDB
    -Dmongo.db2=MongoMKDB2

Note that the configured test databases will be *dropped* by the test cases.
