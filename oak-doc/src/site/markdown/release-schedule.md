# Release Schedule

Here is the frequency where the team **aim** to cut new releases. As we
strive for quality rather than frequency the date may slip according
to needs.

- Trunk: every 2 weeks (2 / month, ~26 /year)
- 1.8: every 4 weeks (1 / month, ~12 / year)
- 1.6: every 8 weeks (1 / other month, ~6 / year)
- 1.4: every 13 weeks (1 / quarter, ~4 / year)
- 1.2: every 13 weeks (1 / quarter, ~4 / year)
- 1.0: every 26 weeks (~2 / year)
