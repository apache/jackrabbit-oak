# Releases

## Schedule

We *aim* at keeping this frequency for releses. However dates may slip 
according to needs

- trunk: every 8 weeks (~6 / year)
- 1.10: every 4 weeks (~12 / year)
- 1.8: every 8 weeks (~6 / year)
- 1.6: every 13 weeks (~4 / year)
- 1.4: every 26 weeks (~2 / year)
- 1.2: every 52 weeks (1 / year)
- 1.0: every 52 weeks (1 / year)

## Strategies

For a full discussion around these topics see in [oak-dev archives](https://lists.apache.org/thread.html/9a7c0e2fdfab5deb051fbd99add6c2b7109d750805b6182138eece55@%3Coak-dev.jackrabbit.apache.org%3E).

- trunk will be considered stable
- only releases from trunk other than existing branches
- any previous release from trunk will be automatically deprecated

## Branching

Branching will not happen other than in specific circumstances. Such as,
but not limited to:

- incompatible API changes
- incompatible JVM changes
- updates to dependencies that breaks backward compatibility

In short: most probably it will always be around non-backward-compatible
changes

Anyhow in such cases the branching is not automatic and will be
discussed between PMCs a best course of actions. Alternatives may be a
different way to implement something breaking.

## Version Numbers

- Released versions will be in the format of `Major.Minor.Patch` where,
as rule of thumb we will increase


    MAJOR for incompatible API changes    
    MINOR for new backwards-compatible functionality
    PATCH for backwards-compatible bug fixes.

- We'll keep the even/odd schema
- Any new official release will be always even: 1.12.0, 1.14.0, 1.16.0,
..., 1.124.0
- A release will always be with a patch number (the last part) of `.0`.
This ease OSGi deployments.
- Diagnostic builds will be cut with the odd version and `-Rxxx` such as
`1.15-R12345`.
- In case of branching the increased part will always be the PATCH so:
`1.16.0`, `1.16.1`, `1.16.2`, etc.
- In case of branching the diagnostic build will follow the current
pattern: `1.16.5-R12345`
