Oak Documentation
=================

The Oak documentation lives as Markdown files in `src/site/markdown` such
that it easy to view e.g. from GitHub. Alternatively the Maven site plugin
can be used to build and deploy a web site as follows:

From the reactor do

    mvn clean install -Pdoc -pl :oak-doc-railroad-macro # oak-doc requires to be installed locally as this module isn't released
    mvn clean -Pdoc

to clean any existing site,

    mvn site -Pdoc

to build the site **without** Javadoc, and optionally

    mvn site -Pjavadoc

to add Javadoc. 

   mvn site -Pdoc,javadoc

to generate **both** site and javadocs. Review the site at
`oak-doc/target/site`.

Then deploy the site to `http://jackrabbit.apache.org/oak/docs/` using

    mvn site-deploy -Pdoc

Finally review the site at `http://jackrabbit.apache.org/oak/docs/index.html`.
To skip the final commit during the deploy phase you can specify
`-Dscmpublish.skipCheckin=true`. You can then review all pending changes in
`oak-doc/target/scmpublish-checkout` and follow up with `svn commit` manually.

*Note*: `mvn clean` needs to be run as a separate command as otherwise generating
the Javadocs would not work correctly due to issues with module ordering.

Every committer should be able to deploy the site. No fiddling with
credentials needed since deployment is done via svn commit to
`https://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/jackrabbit/site/live/oak/docs`.
