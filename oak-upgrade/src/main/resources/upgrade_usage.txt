Usage: ${command} [options] jcr2_source [destination]
       (to upgrade a JCR 2 repository)

       ${command} [options] source destination
       (to migrate an Oak repository)

# jcr2_source

It's a path to the repository directory and optionally the repository.xml file,
for instance:

  crx-quickstart/repository
  my-instance/repository somewhere-else/repository.xml

If there is no destination, repository will be converted to a segment node store
in-place. Old files will be moved to the repository/crx2 directory.

# source / destination

An descriptor of the Oak node store. Possible options:

  * path to the segment store
  * jdbc:... (requires passing username and password as separate parameters)
  * mongodb://host:port/database

--cache <int>             Cache size in MB (default: 256)
--mmap                    Enable memory mapped file access for Segment Store

--src-password            Source rdb password
