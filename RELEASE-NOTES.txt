Release Notes -- Apache Jackrabbit Oak -- Version 1.68.0

Introduction
------------

Jackrabbit Oak is a scalable, high-performance hierarchical content
repository designed for use as the foundation of modern world-class
web sites and other demanding content applications.

Apache Jackrabbit Oak 1.68.0 is an incremental feature release based
on and compatible with earlier stable Jackrabbit Oak 1.x
releases. This release is considered stable and targeted for
production use.

While Oak 1.68.0 compiles and tests successfully on Java 17, Javadocs
generation fails on Java 17 (but works as expected on Java 11).

The Oak effort is a part of the Apache Jackrabbit project.
Apache Jackrabbit is a project of the Apache Software Foundation.
