Release Notes -- Apache Jackrabbit Oak -- Version 1.2.0

Introduction
------------

Jackrabbit Oak is a scalable, high-performance hierarchical content
repository designed for use as the foundation of modern world-class
web sites and other demanding content applications.

Jackrabbit Oak 1.2 is an incremental feature release based on and
compatible with earlier stable Jackrabbit Oak 1.x releases.
Jackrabbit Oak 1.2.x releases are considered stable and targeted for
production use.

The Oak effort is a part of the Apache Jackrabbit project.
