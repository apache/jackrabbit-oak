/**
 * The MicroKernel <b>Design Goals and Principles</b>:
 * <ul>
 * <li>manage huge trees of nodes and properties efficiently</li>
 * <li>MVCC-based concurrency control
 * (writers don't interfere with readers, snapshot isolation)</li>
 * <li>GIT/SVN-inspired DAG-based versioning model</li>
 * <li>highly scalable concurrent read & write operations</li>
 * <li>session-less API (there's no concept of sessions; an implementation doesn't need to track/manage session state)</li>
 * <li>easily portable to C</li>
 * <li>easy to remote</li>
 * <li>efficient support for large number of child nodes</li>
 * <li>integrated API for efficiently storing/retrieving large binaries</li>
 * <li>human-readable data serialization (JSON)</li>
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * The MicroKernel <b>Data Model</b>:
 * </p>
 * <ul>
 * <li>simple JSON-inspired data model: just nodes and properties</li>
 * <li>a node consists of an unordered set of name -&gt; item mappings. each
 * property and child node is uniquely named and a single name can only
 * refer to a property or a child node, not both at the same time.
 * <li>properties are represented as name/value pairs</li>
 * <li>supported property types: string, number, boolean, array</li>
 * <li>a property value is stored and used as an opaque, unparsed character sequence</li>
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * The <b>Retention Policy for Revisions</b>:
 * <p>
 * TODO specify retention policy for old revisions, i.e. minimal guaranteed retention period (OAK-114)
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * The <b>Retention Policy for Binaries</b>:
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * The MicroKernel implementation is free to remove binaries if both of the
 * following conditions are met:
 * </p>
 * <ul>
 * <li>If the binary is not references as a property value of the
 * format ":blobId:&lt;blobId&gt;" where &lt;blobId&gt; is the id returned by
 * {@link #write(InputStream in)}. This includes simple property values such as
 * {"bin": ":blobId:1234"} as well as array property values such as
 * {"array": [":blobId:1234", ":blobId:5678"]}.</li>
 * <li>If the binary was stored before the last retained revision (this is to
 * keep temporary binaries, and binaries that are not yet referenced).</li>
 * </ul>

     * <li>If the value of {@code :childNodeCount} is larger than the number
     * of returned child nodes, then the node has more child nodes than those
     * included in the returned tree.</li>
     * </ul>
     * The {@code offset} parameter is only applied to the direct child nodes
     * of the root of the returned node tree. {@code maxChildNodes} however
     * is applied on all hierarchy levels.
     * <p>
     * An {@code IllegalArgumentException} is thrown if both an {@code offset}
     * greater than zero and a {@code filter} on node names (see below) have been
     * specified.
     * <p>
     * The order of the child nodes is stable for any given {@code revisionId},
     * i.e. calling {@code getNodes} repeatedly with the same {@code revisionId}
     * is guaranteed to return the child nodes in the same order, but the
     * specific order used is implementation-dependent and may change across
     * different revisions of the same node.
     * <p>
     * The optional {@code filter} parameter allows to specify glob patterns for names of
     * nodes and/or properties to be included or excluded.
     * <p>
     * Example:
     * <pre>
     * {
     *   "nodes": [ "foo*", "-foo1" ],
     *   "properties": [ "*", "-:childNodeCount" ]
     * }
     * </pre>
     * In the above example all child nodes with names starting with "foo" will
     * be included, except for nodes named "foo1"; similarly, all properties will
     * be included except for the ":childNodeCount" metadata property (see below).
     * <p>
     * Glob Syntax:
     * <ul>
     * <li>a {@code nodes} or {@code properties} filter consists of one or more <i>globs</i>.</li>
     * <li>a <i>glob</i> prefixed by {@code -} (dash) is treated as an exclusion pattern;
     * all others are considered inclusion patterns.</li>
     * <li>a leading {@code -} (dash) must be escaped by prepending {@code \} (backslash)
     * if it should be interpreted as a literal.</li>
     * <li>{@code *} (asterisk) serves as a <i>wildcard</i>, i.e. it matches any
     * substring in the target name.</li>
     * <li>{@code *} (asterisk) occurrences within the glob to be interpreted as
     * literals must be escaped by prepending {@code \} (backslash).</li>
     * <li>a filter matches a target name if any of the inclusion patterns match but
     * none of the exclusion patterns.</li>
     * </ul>
     * If no filter is specified the implicit default filter is assumed:
     * {@code {"nodes":["*"],"properties":["*"]}}
     * <p>
     * System-provided metadata properties:
     * <ul>
     *     <li>{@code :childNodeCount} provides the actual number of direct child nodes; this property
     *     is included by the implicit default filter. it can be excluded by specifying a filter such
     *     as {@code {properties:["*", "-:childNodeCount"]}}</li>
     *     <li>{@code :hash} provides a content-based identifier for the subtree
     *     rooted at the {@code :hash} property's parent node. {@code :hash} values
     *     are similar to fingerprints. they can be compared to quickly determine
     *     if two subtrees are identical. if the {@code :hash} values are different
     *     the respective subtrees are different with regard to structure and/or properties.
     *     if on the other hand the {@code :hash} values are identical the respective
     *     subtrees are identical with regard to structure and properties.
     *     {@code :hash} is <i>not</i> included by the implicit default filter.
     *     it can be included by specifying a filter such as {@code {properties:["*", ":hash"]}}.
     *     <p>Returning the {@code :hash} property is optional. Some implementations
     *     might only return it on specific nodes or might not support it at all.
     *     If however a {@code :hash} property is returned it has to obey the contract
     *     described above.</p>
     *     <p>Implementations that keep track of the child hash along with
     *     the child node name can return the {@code :hash} value also as
     *     a property of the child node objects, even if they'd otherwise
     *     be empty, for example due to a depth limit. If such child hashes
     *     are returned, the client can use them as an alternative to child
     *     paths when accessing those nodes.</li>
     *     <li>{@code :id} provides an implementation-specific identifier
     *     of a node. Identifiers are like content hashes as described above,
     *     except for the fact that two different identifiers may refer to
     *     identical subtrees. Also {@code :id} values may be returned for
     *     child nodes, in which case the client can use them for accessing
     *     those nodes.
     *     </li>
