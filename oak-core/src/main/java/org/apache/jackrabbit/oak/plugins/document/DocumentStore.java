 * The interface for the backend storage for documents.

 * In general atomicity of operations on a DocumentStore are limited to a single
 * document. That is, an implementation does not have to guarantee atomicity of
 * the entire effect of a method call. A method that fails with an exception may
 * have modified just some documents and then abort. However, an implementation
 * must not modify a document partially. Either the complete update operation is
 * applied to a document or no modification is done at all.
 * <p>
 * Even though none of the methods declare an exception, they will still throw
 * an implementation specific runtime exception when the operations fails (e.g.
 * an I/O error occurs).
 * <p>
 * The key is the id of a document. Keys are opaque strings. All characters are
 * allowed. Leading and trailing whitespace is allowed. For keys, the maximum
 * length is 512 bytes in the UTF-8 representation (in the latest Unicode
 * version).
