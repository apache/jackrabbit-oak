/**
 * A node in a content tree consists of child nodes and properties, each
 * of which evolves through different states during its lifecycle. This
 * interface represents a specific, immutable state of a node. The state
 * consists of an unordered set of name -&gt; item mappings, where
 * each item is either a property or a child node.
 * <p>
 * Depending on context, a NodeState instance can be interpreted as
 * representing the state of just that node, of the subtree starting at
 * that node, or of an entire tree in case it's a root node.
 * <p>
 * The crucial difference between this interface and the similarly named
 * class in Jackrabbit 2.x is that this interface represents a specific,
 * immutable state of a node, whereas the Jackrabbit 2.x class represented
 * the <em>current</em> state of a node.
 *
 * <h2>Immutability and thread-safety</h2>
 * <p>
 * As mentioned above, all node and property states are always immutable.
 * Thus repeating a method call is always guaranteed to produce the same
 * result as before unless some internal error occurs (see below). This
 * immutability only applies to a specific state instance. Different states
 * of a node can obviously be different, and in some cases even different
 * instances of the same state may behave slightly differently. For example
 * due to performance optimization or other similar changes the iteration
 * order of properties or child nodes may be different for two instances
 * of the same state.
 * <p>
 * In addition to being immutable, a specific state instance guaranteed to
 * be fully thread-safe. Possible caching or other internal changes need to
 * be properly synchronized so that any number of concurrent clients can
 * safely access a state instance.
 *
 * <h2>Persistence and error-handling</h2>
 * <p>
 * A node state can be (and often is) backed by local files or network
 * resources. All IO operations or related concerns like caching should be
 * handled transparently below this interface. Potential IO problems and
 * recovery attempts like retrying a timed-out network access need to be
 * handled below this interface, and only hard errors should be thrown up
 * as {@link RuntimeException unchecked exceptions} that higher level code
 * is not expected to be able to recover from.
 * <p>
 * Since this interface exposes no higher level constructs like access
 * controls, locking, node types or even path parsing, there's no way
 * for content access to fail because of such concerns. Such functionality
 * and related checked exceptions or other control flow constructs should
 * be implemented on a higher level above this interface.
 *
 * <h2>Decoration and virtual content</h2>
 * <p>
 * Not all content exposed by this interface needs to be backed by actual
 * persisted data. An implementation may want to provide derived data,
 * like for example the aggregate size of the entire subtree as an
 * extra virtual property. A virtualization, sharding or caching layer
 * could provide a composite view over multiple underlying trees.
 * Or a basic access control layer could decide to hide certain content
 * based on specific rules. All such features need to be implemented
 * according to the API contract of this interface. A separate higher level
 * interface needs to be used if an implementation can't for example
 * guarantee immutability of exposed content as discussed above.
 *
 * <h2>Equality and hash codes</h2>
 * <p>
 * Two node states are considered equal if and only if their properties and
 * child nodes match, regardless of ordering. The
 * {@link Object#equals(Object)} method needs to be implemented so that it
 * complies with this definition. And while node states are not meant for
 * use as hash keys, the {@link Object#hashCode()} method should still be
 * implemented according to this equality contract.
