 * The query engine will pick the index that returns the lowest cost for the

 * <p>
 * The index should only use that part of the filter that speeds up data lookup.
 * All other filter conditions should be ignored and not evaluated within this
 * index, because the query engine will in any case evaluate the condition (and
 * join condition), so that evaluating the conditions within the index would
 * actually slow down processing. For example, an index on the property
 * "lastName" should not try to evaluate any other restrictions than those on
 * the property "lastName", even if the query contains other restrictions. For
 * the query "where lastName = 'x' and firstName = 'y'", the query engine will
 * set two filter conditions, one for "lastName" and another for "firstName".
 * The index on "lastName" should not evaluate the condition on "firstName",
 * even thought it will be set in the filter.
