/**
 * <pre>
 * Module: Principal Management
 * =============================================================================
 *
 * Title: Everyone Test
 * -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 *
 * Goal:
 * Understand the role of the {@link org.apache.jackrabbit.oak.spi.security.principal.EveryonePrincipal}
 *
 * Exercises:
 *
 * - {@link #testEveryoneExists()}
 *   Test to illustrate the that everyone principal always exists and always is
 *   an instanceof {@link org.apache.jackrabbit.api.security.principal.GroupPrincipal} even if
 *   there is no corresponding authorizable.
 *   Discuss the meaning of the everyone principal and why having a corresponding authorizable is optional.
 *   Note the difference between GroupPrincipal and org.apache.jackrabbit.api.security.user.Group.
 *
 * - {@link #testEveryoneName()}
 *   Test to illustrate that the name of the everyone principal is constant.
 *   Complete the test case by typing the expected name.
 *
 * - {@link #testAccessByName()}
 *   Even though there exists a dedicated method to retrieve the everyone principal
 *   you can equally access it by name.
 *   Use the principal management API to retrieve the everyone principal by name.
 *   Discuss the drawback of this approach in an environment where you don't have access to the Oak constants.
 *
 * - {@link #testEveryoneIsMemberofEveryone()}
 *   Test case illustrating the dynamic nature of the everyone principal.
 *   Walk through the test
 *   Try to extend the test such that the default principal management exposes additional user|group principals.
 *
 * - {@link #testEveryoneAsAuthorizableGroup()}
 *   Additional test illustrating that the dynamic nature of the everyone principal
 *   does not change if there exists a corresponding authorizable group.
 *   > Create a new authorizable that corresponds to the everyone principal (Q: what parameters are constants?)
 *   > Verify that principal exposed by the authorizable corresponds to the everyone principal.
 *   > Assert that the dynamic nature of the principal has not changed.
 *   > Test if the dynamic nature also applies to the authorizable
 *
 *
 * Additional Exercises:
 * -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 *
 * The following exercises can easily be performed in a Sling based repository
 * installation (e.g. Granite|CQ) with the same setup as in this test class.
 *
 * - Test if there exists an everyone authorizable group.
 *   If this is the case try what happens if you remove that authorizable and discuss the consequences.
 *   Question: Can you explain why it exists?
 *
