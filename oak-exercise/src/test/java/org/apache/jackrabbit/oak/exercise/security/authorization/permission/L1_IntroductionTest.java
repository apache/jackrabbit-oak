/**
 * <pre>
 * Module: Authorization (Permission Evaluation)
 * =============================================================================
 *
 * Title: Introduction
 * -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 *
 * Become familiar with the way to verify permissions using JCR API.
 * Get a basic understanding how permission evaluation is used and exposed in Oak
 * and finally gain insight into some details of the default implementation.
 *
 * Exercises:
 *
 * - Overview and Usages of Permission Evaluation
 *   Search and list for permission related methods in the JCR API and recap what
 *   the specification states about permissions compared to access control
 *   management.
 *
 *   Question: What are the areas in JCR that deal with permissions?
 *   Question: Who is the expected API consumer?
 *   Question: Can you elaborate when it actually makes sense to use this API?
 *   Question: Can you think about potential drawbacks of doing so?
 *
 * - Permission Evaluation in Oak
 *   In a second step try to become more familiar with the nature of the
 *   permission evaluation in Oak.
 *
 *   Question: What is the nature of the public SPI?
 *   Question: Can you identify the main entry point for permission evaluation?
 *   Question: Can you identify to exact location(s) in Oak where read-access is being enforced?
 *   Question: Can you identify the exact location(s) in Oak where all kind of write access is being enforced?
 *
 * - Configuration
 *   Look at the default implementation(s) of the {@link org.apache.jackrabbit.oak.spi.security.authorization.AuthorizationConfiguration}
 *   and try to identify the configurable parts with respect to permission evaluation.
 *   Compare your results with the Oak documentation.
 *
 *   Question: Can you provide a list of configuration options for the permission evaluation?
 *   Question: Can you identify where these configuration options are being evaluated?
 *   Question: Which options also affect the access control management?
 *
 * - Pluggability
 *   Become familar with the pluggable parts of the permission evaluation
 *
 *   Question: What means does Oak provide to change or extend the permission evaluation?
 *   Question: Can you identify the interfaces that you needed to implement?
 *   Question: Would it be possible to only replace the implementation of {@link org.apache.jackrabbit.oak.spi.security.authorization.permission.PermissionProvider}?
 *             How could you achieve this?
 *             And what would be the consequences for the whole authorization module?
 *
 *
 * Advanced Exercises:
 * -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 *
 * - Read Permission Walkthrough
 *   Use {@link #testReadPermissionWalkThrough()} to become familiar with the
 *   very internals of the permission evaluation. Walk through the item read
 *   methods (for simplicity reduced to oak-core only) and be aware of
 *   permission-evaluation related parts.
 *
 *   Question: Can you list the relevant steps wrt permission evalution?
 *   Question: What is the nature of the returned tree objects?
 *   Question: How can you verify if the editing test session can actually read those trees without using the permission-evaluation code?
 *   Question: How can you verify if the properties are accessible.
 *
 * - Write Permission Walkthrough
 *   Use {@link #testWritePermissionWalkThrough()} to become familiar with the
 *   internals of the permission evaluation with respect to writing. Walk through
 *   the item write methods (for simplicity reduced to oak-core only) and the
 *   subsequent {@link org.apache.jackrabbit.oak.api.Root#commit()} and be aware
 *   of permission-evaluation related parts.
 *
 *   Question: Can you list the relevant steps wrt permission evalution?
 *   Question: What can you say about write permissions for special (protected) items?
 *
 * - Extending {@link #testReadPermissionWalkThrough()} and {@link #testWritePermissionWalkThrough()}
 *   Use the two test-cases and play with additional access/writes and or
 *   additional (more complex) permission setup.
