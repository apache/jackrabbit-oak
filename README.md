Jackrabbit Oak - the next generation content repository
=======================================================

Jackrabbit Oak is a scalable, high-performance hierarchical content
repository designed for use as the foundation of modern world-class
web sites and other demanding content applications.

The Oak effort is a part of the Apache Jackrabbit project.
Apache Jackrabbit is a project of the Apache Software Foundation.

Getting Started
---------------

To get started with Oak, build the latest sources with
Maven 3 and Java 8 (or higher) like this:

    mvn clean install

To enable all integration tests, including the JCR TCK, use:

    mvn clean install -PintegrationTesting

Before committing changes or submitting a patch, please make sure that
the above integration testing build passes without errors. If you like,
you can enable integration tests by default by setting the
`OAK_INTEGRATION_TESTING` environment variable.

MongoDB integration
-------------------

Parts of the Oak build expects a MongoDB instance to be available for
testing. By default a MongoDB instance running on localhost is expected,
and the relevant tests are simply skipped if such an instance is not found.
You can also configure the build to use custom MongoDB settings with the
following properties (shown with their default values):

    -Dmongo.host=127.0.0.1
    -Dmongo.port=27017
    -Dmongo.db=MongoMKDB
    -Dmongo.db2=MongoMKDB2

Note that the configured test databases will be *dropped* by the test cases.
