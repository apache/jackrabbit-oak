/**
 * Simple concurrent LRU cache, using a "double barrel" approach where two ConcurrentHashMaps record
 * entries.
 *
 * <p>At any given time, one hash is primary and the other
 * is secondary.  {@link #get} first checks primary, and if that's a miss, checks secondary.  If
 * secondary has the entry, it's promoted to primary (<b>NOTE</b>: the key is cloned at this point).
 * Once primary is full, the secondary is cleared and the two are swapped.</p>
 *
 * <p>This is not as space efficient as other possible
 * concurrent approaches (see LUCENE-2075): to achieve perfect LRU(N) it requires 2*N storage.  But,
 * this approach is relatively simple and seems in practice to not grow unbounded in size when under
 * hideously high load.</p>
