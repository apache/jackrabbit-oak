/**
 * File-based {@link Directory} implementation that uses mmap for reading, and
 * {@link FSDirectory.FSIndexOutput} for writing.
 *
 * <p><b>NOTE</b>: memory mapping uses up a portion of the
 * virtual memory address space in your process equal to the size of the file being mapped.  Before
 * using this class, be sure your have plenty of virtual address space, e.g. by using a 64 bit JRE,
 * or a 32 bit JRE with indexes that are guaranteed to fit within the address space. On 32 bit
 * platforms also consult {@link #MMapDirectory(File, LockFactory, int)} if you have problems with
 * mmap failing because of fragmented address space. If you get an OutOfMemoryException, it is
 * recommended to reduce the chunk size, until it works.
 *
 * <p>Due to <a href="http://bugs.sun.com/bugdatabase/view_bug.do?bug_id=4724038">
 * this bug</a> in Sun's JRE, MMapDirectory's {@link IndexInput#close} is unable to close the
 * underlying OS file handle.  Only when GC finally collects the underlying objects, which could be
 * quite some time later, will the file handle be closed.
 *
 * <p>This will consume additional transient disk usage: on Windows,
 * attempts to delete or overwrite the files will result in an exception; on other platforms, which
 * typically have a &quot;delete on last close&quot; semantics, while such operations will succeed,
 * the bytes are still consuming space on disk.  For many applications this limitation is not a
 * problem (e.g. if you have plenty of disk space, and you don't rely on overwriting files on
 * Windows) but it's still an important limitation to be aware of.
 *
 * <p>This class supplies the workaround mentioned in the bug report
 * (see {@link #setUseUnmap}), which may fail on non-Sun JVMs. It forcefully unmaps the buffer on
 * close by using an undocumented internal cleanup functionality. {@link #UNMAP_SUPPORTED} is
 * <code>true</code>, if the workaround can be enabled (with no guarantees).
 * <p>
 * <b>NOTE:</b> Accessing this class either directly or
 * indirectly from a thread while it's interrupted can close the underlying channel immediately if
 * at the same time the thread is blocked on IO. The channel will remain closed and subsequent
 * access to {@link MMapDirectory} will throw a {@link ClosedChannelException}.
 * </p>
