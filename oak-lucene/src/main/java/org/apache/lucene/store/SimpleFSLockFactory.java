/**
 * <p>Implements {@link LockFactory} using {@link
 * File#createNewFile()}.</p>
 *
 * <p><b>NOTE:</b> the {@linkplain File#createNewFile() javadocs
 * for <code>File.createNewFile()</code>} contain a vague yet spooky warning about not using the API
 * for file locking.  This warning was added due to <a target="_top"
 * href="http://bugs.sun.com/bugdatabase/view_bug.do?bug_id=4676183">this bug</a>, and in fact the
 * only known problem with using this API for locking is that the Lucene write lock may not be
 * released when the JVM exits abnormally.</p>
 *
 * <p>When this happens, a {@link LockObtainFailedException}
 * is hit when trying to create a writer, in which case you need to explicitly clear the lock file
 * first.  You can either manually remove the file, or use the
 * {@link org.apache.lucene.index.IndexWriter#unlock(Directory)} API.  But, first be certain that no
 * writer is in fact writing to the index otherwise you can easily corrupt your index.</p>
 *
 * <p>If you suspect that this or any other LockFactory is
 * not working properly in your environment, you can easily test it by using
 * {@link VerifyingLockFactory}, {@link LockVerifyServer} and {@link LockStressTest}.</p>
