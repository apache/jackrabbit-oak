/**
 * <p>Implements {@link LockFactory} using native OS file
 * locks.  Note that because this LockFactory relies on java.nio.* APIs for locking, any problems
 * with those APIs will cause locking to fail.  Specifically, on certain NFS environments the
 * java.nio.* locks will fail (the lock can incorrectly be double acquired) whereas
 * {@link SimpleFSLockFactory} worked perfectly in those same environments.  For NFS based access to
 * an index, it's recommended that you try {@link SimpleFSLockFactory} first and work around the one
 * limitation that a lock file could be left when the JVM exits abnormally.</p>
 *
 * <p>The primary benefit of {@link NativeFSLockFactory} is
 * that lock files will be properly removed (by the OS) if the JVM has an abnormal exit.</p>
 *
 * <p>Note that, unlike {@link SimpleFSLockFactory}, the existence of
 * leftover lock files in the filesystem on exiting the JVM is fine because the OS will free the
 * locks held against these files even though the files still remain.</p>
 *
 * <p>If you suspect that this or any other LockFactory is
 * not working properly in your environment, you can easily test it by using
 * {@link VerifyingLockFactory}, {@link LockVerifyServer} and {@link LockStressTest}.</p>
