 * A {@link Scorer} which wraps another scorer and caches the score of the

 * result and will not invoke the wrapped Scorer's score() method, unless the
 * current document has changed.<br>
 * This class might be useful due to the changes done to the {@link Collector}
 * interface, in which the score is not computed for a document by default, only
 * if the collector requests it. Some collectors may need to use the score in
 * several places, however all they have in hand is a {@link Scorer} object, and
 * might end up computing the score of a document more than once.
