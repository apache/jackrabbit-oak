/**
 * This package contains the delegates for the various JCR API entities. While the JCR API
 * implementation classes directly implement the client facing JCR API, they do so without
 * implementing much of the business logic themselves but rather rely on the functionality provided
 * by the delegates. This separation of the JCR functionality into external and internal variants
 * guarantees that JCR API consumers cannot gain access to internals by simply casting to an
 * implementation class. Further it makes internal round-tripping through the JCR API unnecessary
 * since all functionality is provided by the internal interface (i.e. delegates), which simplifies
 * maintaining and checking state invariants.<p>
 *
 * <b>Responsibilities of JCR API implementation classes:</b>
 * <ul>
 * <li>Prevent access to internals.</li>
 * <li>Name/path mapping for both method arguments and return values.</li>
 * <li>Tracking and instantiation of other JCR implementation objects.</li>
 * <li>Conversion from JCR Values to PropertyState instances and vice versa.</li>
 * <li>No direct access to the Oak API</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <b>Responsibilities of the delegate classes:</b>
 * <ul>
 * <li>Business logic associated with complex JCR operations.</li>
 * <li>Provide means for state invariant checking.</li>
 * <li>Must no refer to neither the JCR API nor its implementation classes.</li>
 * </ul>
