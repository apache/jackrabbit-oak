/**
 * Extension of the {@code JackrabbitAccessControlList} that is bound to a {@link Principal}.
 * Consequently, all entries returned by {@link #getAccessControlEntries()} will return the same value
 * as {@link #getPrincipal()} and only entries associated with this very principal can be added/removed from this list.
 * In addition this implies that each entry contained within the {@code PrincipalAccessControlList} defines the target
 * object where it will take effect, which can either be an absolute path to a node or {@code null} if the entry takes
 * effect at the repository level.
 * <p>
 * Typically applicable, existing and effective policies of this type of access control list are expected to be obtained
 * through calls of
 * {@link org.apache.jackrabbit.api.security.JackrabbitAccessControlManager#getApplicablePolicies(Principal)},
 * {@link org.apache.jackrabbit.api.security.JackrabbitAccessControlManager#getPolicies(Principal)} and
 * {@link org.apache.jackrabbit.api.security.JackrabbitAccessControlManager#getEffectivePolicies(Set)}, respectively.
 * <p>
 * Whether or not accessing {@code PrincipalAccessControlList} policies by path is supported is an implementation detail.
 * If it is supported the {@code absPath} parameter specified with {@link javax.jcr.security.AccessControlManager#getApplicablePolicies(String)}
 * and {@link javax.jcr.security.AccessControlManager#getPolicies(String)} will correspond to the path of the policy.
 * <p>
 * As far as the best-effort method {@link javax.jcr.security.AccessControlManager#getEffectivePolicies(String)} is
 * concerned, the {@link Entry#getEffectivePath() effective path} defined with the individual entries will be consulted
 * in order to compute the policies that take effect at a given path.
 *
 * Irrespective on whether access by path is suppported or not the {@link JackrabbitAccessControlPolicy#getPath() path}
 * of the policy points to the access controlled node it is bound to and will be used to
 * {@link javax.jcr.security.AccessControlManager#setPolicy(String, AccessControlPolicy) set} and
 * {@link javax.jcr.security.AccessControlManager#removePolicy(String, AccessControlPolicy) remove} the policy.
 * This access controlled node may or may not be associated with an (optional) representation of the associated
 * {@code Principal} inside the repository.
