   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR USE, REPRODUCTION, AND DISTRIBUTION

   1. Definitions.

      "License" shall mean the terms and conditions for use, reproduction,

      "Legal Entity" shall mean the union of the acting entity and all
      other entities that control, are controlled by, or are under common
      control with that entity. For the purposes of this definition,

      direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or
      otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the

      "You" (or "Your") shall mean an individual or Legal Entity
      exercising permissions granted by this License.

      "Source" form shall mean the preferred form for making modifications,
      including but not limited to software source code, documentation
      source, and configuration files.

      "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
      transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
      not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
      and conversions to other media types.

      "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
      Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
      copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
      (an example is provided in the Appendix below).

      "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
      form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
      editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
      represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
      of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
      separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
      the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

      "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
      the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
      to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
      submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
      or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
      the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
      means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
      to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
      communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
      and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
      Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
      excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
      designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."

      "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
      on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
      subsequently incorporated within the Work.

   2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
      publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
      Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

   3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
      use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
      where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
      as of the date such litigation is filed.

   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
      meet the following conditions:

      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
          stating that You changed the files; and

      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
          the Derivative Works; and

      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
          as modifying the License.

      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
      the conditions stated in this License.

   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

AspectJ runtime library (aspectjrt)

    Eclipse Public License - v 1.0

    THE ACCOMPANYING PROGRAM IS PROVIDED UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS ECLIPSE
    PUBLIC LICENSE ("AGREEMENT"). ANY USE, REPRODUCTION OR DISTRIBUTION OF
    THE PROGRAM CONSTITUTES RECIPIENT'S ACCEPTANCE OF THIS AGREEMENT.

    1. DEFINITIONS

    "Contribution" means:

    a) in the case of the initial Contributor, the initial code and
       documentation distributed under this Agreement, and

    b) in the case of each subsequent Contributor:

       i) changes to the Program, and

       ii) additions to the Program;

       where such changes and/or additions to the Program originate from and
       are distributed by that particular Contributor. A Contribution
       'originates' from a Contributor if it was added to the Program by
       such Contributor itself or anyone acting on such Contributor's behalf.
       Contributions do not include additions to the Program which: (i) are
       separate modules of software distributed in conjunction with the
       Program under their own license agreement, and (ii) are not derivative
       works of the Program.

    "Contributor" means any person or entity that distributes the Program.

    "Licensed Patents " mean patent claims licensable by a Contributor which
    are necessarily infringed by the use or sale of its Contribution alone or
    when combined with the Program.

    "Program" means the Contributions distributed in accordance with this
    Agreement.

    "Recipient" means anyone who receives the Program under this Agreement,
    including all Contributors.

    2. GRANT OF RIGHTS

    a) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby grants
       Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free copyright license to
       reproduce, prepare derivative works of, publicly display, publicly
       perform, distribute and sublicense the Contribution of such
       Contributor, if any, and such derivative works, in source code and
       object code form.

    b) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby grants
       Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent license under
       Licensed Patents to make, use, sell, offer to sell, import and
       otherwise transfer the Contribution of such Contributor, if any, in
       source code and object code form. This patent license shall apply to
       the combination of the Contribution and the Program if, at the time
       the Contribution is added by the Contributor, such addition of the
       Contribution causes such combination to be covered by the Licensed
       Patents. The patent license shall not apply to any other combinations
       which include the Contribution. No hardware per se is licensed hereunder.

    c) Recipient understands that although each Contributor grants the
       licenses to its Contributions set forth herein, no assurances are
       provided by any Contributor that the Program does not infringe the
       patent or other intellectual property rights of any other entity. Each
       Contributor disclaims any liability to Recipient for claims brought by
       any other entity based on infringement of intellectual property rights
       or otherwise. As a condition to exercising the rights and licenses
       granted hereunder, each Recipient hereby assumes sole responsibility
       to secure any other intellectual property rights needed, if any. For
       example, if a third party patent license is required to allow Recipient
       to distribute the Program, it is Recipient's responsibility to acquire
       that license before distributing the Program.

    d) Each Contributor represents that to its knowledge it has sufficient
       copyright rights in its Contribution, if any, to grant the copyright
       license set forth in this Agreement.

    3. REQUIREMENTS

    A Contributor may choose to distribute the Program in object code form
    under its own license agreement, provided that:

    a) it complies with the terms and conditions of this Agreement; and

    b) its license agreement:

       i)   effectively disclaims on behalf of all Contributors all warranties
            and conditions, express and implied, including warranties or
            conditions of title and non-infringement, and implied warranties
            or conditions of merchantability and fitness for a particular
            purpose;

       ii)  effectively excludes on behalf of all Contributors all liability
            for damages, including direct, indirect, special, incidental and
            consequential damages, such as lost profits;

       iii) states that any provisions which differ from this Agreement are
            offered by that Contributor alone and not by any other party; and

       iv)  states that source code for the Program is available from such
            Contributor, and informs licensees how to obtain it in a
            reasonable manner on or through a medium customarily used for
            software exchange.

    When the Program is made available in source code form:

    a) it must be made available under this Agreement; and

    b) a copy of this Agreement must be included with each copy of the
       Program.

    Contributors may not remove or alter any copyright notices contained
    within the Program.

    Each Contributor must identify itself as the originator of its
    Contribution, if any, in a manner that reasonably allows subsequent
    Recipients to identify the originator of the Contribution.

    4. COMMERCIAL DISTRIBUTION

    Commercial distributors of software may accept certain responsibilities
    with respect to end users, business partners and the like. While this
    license is intended to facilitate the commercial use of the Program,
    the Contributor who includes the Program in a commercial product offering
    should do so in a manner which does not create potential liability for
    other Contributors. Therefore, if a Contributor includes the Program in
    a commercial product offering, such Contributor ("Commercial Contributor")
    hereby agrees to defend and indemnify every other Contributor
    ("Indemnified Contributor") against any losses, damages and costs
    (collectively "Losses") arising from claims, lawsuits and other legal
    actions brought by a third party against the Indemnified Contributor to
    the extent caused by the acts or omissions of such Commercial Contributor
    in connection with its distribution of the Program in a commercial
    product offering. The obligations in this section do not apply to any
    claims or Losses relating to any actual or alleged intellectual property
    infringement. In order to qualify, an Indemnified Contributor must:
    a) promptly notify the Commercial Contributor in writing of such claim,
    and b) allow the Commercial Contributor to control, and cooperate with
    the Commercial Contributor in, the defense and any related settlement
    negotiations. The Indemnified Contributor may participate in any such
    claim at its own expense.

    For example, a Contributor might include the Program in a commercial
    product offering, Product X. That Contributor is then a Commercial
    Contributor. If that Commercial Contributor then makes performance claims,
    or offers warranties related to Product X, those performance claims and
    warranties are such Commercial Contributor's responsibility alone. Under
    this section, the Commercial Contributor would have to defend claims
    against the other Contributors related to those performance claims and
    warranties, and if a court requires any other Contributor to pay any
    damages as a result, the Commercial Contributor must pay those damages.

    5. NO WARRANTY

    EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, THE PROGRAM IS PROVIDED
    ON AN "AS IS" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, EITHER
    EXPRESS OR IMPLIED INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY WARRANTIES OR
    CONDITIONS OF TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A
    PARTICULAR PURPOSE. Each Recipient is solely responsible for determining
    the appropriateness of using and distributing the Program and assumes all
    risks associated with its exercise of rights under this Agreement ,
    including but not limited to the risks and costs of program errors,
    compliance with applicable laws, damage to or loss of data, programs or
    equipment, and unavailability or interruption of operations.

    6. DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY

    EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, NEITHER RECIPIENT NOR
    ANY CONTRIBUTORS SHALL HAVE ANY LIABILITY FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT,
    INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING
    WITHOUT LIMITATION LOST PROFITS), HOWEVER CAUSED AND ON ANY THEORY OF
    LIABILITY, WHETHER IN CONTRACT, STRICT LIABILITY, OR TORT (INCLUDING
    NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE) ARISING IN ANY WAY OUT OF THE USE OR
    DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM OR THE EXERCISE OF ANY RIGHTS GRANTED
    HEREUNDER, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

    7. GENERAL

    If any provision of this Agreement is invalid or unenforceable under
    applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of
    the remainder of the terms of this Agreement, and without further action
    by the parties hereto, such provision shall be reformed to the minimum
    extent necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable.

    If Recipient institutes patent litigation against any entity (including
    a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Program
    itself (excluding combinations of the Program with other software or
    hardware) infringes such Recipient's patent(s), then such Recipient's
    rights granted under Section 2(b) shall terminate as of the date such
    litigation is filed.

    All Recipient's rights under this Agreement shall terminate if it fails
    to comply with any of the material terms or conditions of this Agreement
    and does not cure such failure in a reasonable period of time after
    becoming aware of such noncompliance. If all Recipient's rights under
    this Agreement terminate, Recipient agrees to cease use and distribution
    of the Program as soon as reasonably practicable. However, Recipient's
    obligations under this Agreement and any licenses granted by Recipient
    relating to the Program shall continue and survive.

    Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute copies of this Agreement,
    but in order to avoid inconsistency the Agreement is copyrighted and may
    only be modified in the following manner. The Agreement Steward reserves
    the right to publish new versions (including revisions) of this Agreement
    from time to time. No one other than the Agreement Steward has the right
    to modify this Agreement. The Eclipse Foundation is the initial Agreement
    Steward. The Eclipse Foundation may assign the responsibility to serve as
    the Agreement Steward to a suitable separate entity. Each new version of
    the Agreement will be given a distinguishing version number. The Program
    (including Contributions) may always be distributed subject to the version
    of the Agreement under which it was received. In addition, after a new
    version of the Agreement is published, Contributor may elect to distribute
    the Program (including its Contributions) under the new version. Except as
    expressly stated in Sections 2(a) and 2(b) above, Recipient receives no
    rights or licenses to the intellectual property of any Contributor under
    this Agreement, whether expressly, by implication, estoppel or otherwise.
    All rights in the Program not expressly granted under this Agreement
    are reserved.

    This Agreement is governed by the laws of the State of New York and the
    intellectual property laws of the United States of America. No party to
    this Agreement will bring a legal action under this Agreement more than
    one year after the cause of action arose. Each party waives its rights to
    a jury trial in any resulting litigation.

         The Initial Developer hereby grants You a world-wide, royalty-free,
         non-exclusive license, subject to third party intellectual property
         claims:
              (a)  under intellectual property rights (other than patent or
              trademark) Licensable by Initial Developer to use, reproduce,
              modify, display, perform, sublicense and distribute the Original
              Code (or portions thereof) with or without Modifications, and/or
              as part of a Larger Work; and

              (b) under Patents Claims infringed by the making, using or
              selling of Original Code, to make, have made, use, practice,
              sell, and offer for sale, and/or otherwise dispose of the
              Original Code (or portions thereof).

              (c) the licenses granted in this Section 2.1(a) and (b) are
              effective on the date Initial Developer first distributes
              Original Code under the terms of this License.

              (d) Notwithstanding Section 2.1(b) above, no patent license is
              granted: 1) for code that You delete from the Original Code; 2)
              separate from the Original Code;  or 3) for infringements caused
              by: i) the modification of the Original Code or ii) the
              combination of the Original Code with other software or devices.

         Subject to third party intellectual property claims, each Contributor

              (a)  under intellectual property rights (other than patent or
              trademark) Licensable by Contributor, to use, reproduce, modify,
              display, perform, sublicense and distribute the Modifications
              created by such Contributor (or portions thereof) either on an
              unmodified basis, with other Modifications, as Covered Code
              and/or as part of a Larger Work; and

              (b) under Patent Claims infringed by the making, using, or
              selling of  Modifications made by that Contributor either alone
              and/or in combination with its Contributor Version (or portions
              of such combination), to make, use, sell, offer for sale, have
              made, and/or otherwise dispose of: 1) Modifications made by that
              Contributor (or portions thereof); and 2) the combination of
              Modifications made by that Contributor with its Contributor
              Version (or portions of such combination).

              (c) the licenses granted in Sections 2.2(a) and 2.2(b) are

              the Covered Code.

              (d)    Notwithstanding Section 2.2(b) above, no patent license is
              granted: 1) for any code that Contributor has deleted from the
              Contributor Version; 2)  separate from the Contributor Version;
              3)  for infringements caused by: i) third party modifications of
              Contributor Version or ii)  the combination of Modifications made
              by that Contributor with other software  (except as part of the
              Contributor Version) or other devices; or 4) under Patent Claims
              infringed by Covered Code in the absence of Modifications made by
              that Contributor.

    3. Distribution Obligations.

         3.1. Application of License.
         The Modifications which You create or to which You contribute are
         governed by the terms of this License, including without limitation
         Section 2.2. The Source Code version of Covered Code may be
         distributed only under the terms of this License or a future version
         of this License released under Section 6.1, and You must include a
         copy of this License with every copy of the Source Code You
         distribute. You may not offer or impose any terms on any Source Code
         version that alters or restricts the applicable version of this
         License or the recipients' rights hereunder. However, You may include
         an additional document offering the additional rights described in
         Section 3.5.

         3.2. Availability of Source Code.
         Any Modification which You create or to which You contribute must be
         made available in Source Code form under the terms of this License
         either on the same media as an Executable version or via an accepted
         Electronic Distribution Mechanism to anyone to whom you made an
         Executable version available; and if made available via Electronic
         Distribution Mechanism, must remain available for at least twelve (12)
         months after the date it initially became available, or at least six
         (6) months after a subsequent version of that particular Modification
         has been made available to such recipients. You are responsible for
         ensuring that the Source Code version remains available even if the
         Electronic Distribution Mechanism is maintained by a third party.

         3.3. Description of Modifications.
         You must cause all Covered Code to which You contribute to contain a
         file documenting the changes You made to create that Covered Code and
         the date of any change. You must include a prominent statement that
         the Modification is derived, directly or indirectly, from Original
         Code provided by the Initial Developer and including the name of the
         Initial Developer in (a) the Source Code, and (b) in any notice in an
         Executable version or related documentation in which You describe the
         origin or ownership of the Covered Code.

         3.4. Intellectual Property Matters
              (a) Third Party Claims.
              If Contributor has knowledge that a license under a third party's
              intellectual property rights is required to exercise the rights
              granted by such Contributor under Sections 2.1 or 2.2,
              Contributor must include a text file with the Source Code
              distribution titled "LEGAL" which describes the claim and the
              party making the claim in sufficient detail that a recipient will
              know whom to contact. If Contributor obtains such knowledge after
              the Modification is made available as described in Section 3.2,
              Contributor shall promptly modify the LEGAL file in all copies
              Contributor makes available thereafter and shall take other steps
              (such as notifying appropriate mailing lists or newsgroups)
              reasonably calculated to inform those who received the Covered
              Code that new knowledge has been obtained.

              (b) Contributor APIs.
              If Contributor's Modifications include an application programming
              interface and Contributor has knowledge of patent licenses which
              are reasonably necessary to implement that API, Contributor must
              also include this information in the LEGAL file.

                   (c)    Representations.
              Contributor represents that, except as disclosed pursuant to
              Section 3.4(a) above, Contributor believes that Contributor's
              Modifications are Contributor's original creation(s) and/or
              Contributor has sufficient rights to grant the rights conveyed by
              this License.

         3.5. Required Notices.
         You must duplicate the notice in Exhibit A in each file of the Source
         Code.  If it is not possible to put such notice in a particular Source
         Code file due to its structure, then You must include such notice in a
         location (such as a relevant directory) where a user would be likely
         to look for such a notice.  If You created one or more Modification(s)
         You may add your name as a Contributor to the notice described in
         Exhibit A.  You must also duplicate this License in any documentation
         for the Source Code where You describe recipients' rights or ownership
         rights relating to Covered Code.  You may choose to offer, and to
         charge a fee for, warranty, support, indemnity or liability
         obligations to one or more recipients of Covered Code. However, You
         may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on behalf of the Initial
         Developer or any Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear than
         any such warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligation is
         offered by You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial
         Developer and every Contributor for any liability incurred by the
         Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result of warranty,
         support, indemnity or liability terms You offer.

         3.6. Distribution of Executable Versions.
         You may distribute Covered Code in Executable form only if the
         requirements of Section 3.1-3.5 have been met for that Covered Code,
         and if You include a notice stating that the Source Code version of
         the Covered Code is available under the terms of this License,
         including a description of how and where You have fulfilled the
         obligations of Section 3.2. The notice must be conspicuously included
         in any notice in an Executable version, related documentation or
         collateral in which You describe recipients' rights relating to the
         Covered Code. You may distribute the Executable version of Covered
         Code or ownership rights under a license of Your choice, which may
         contain terms different from this License, provided that You are in
         compliance with the terms of this License and that the license for the
         Executable version does not attempt to limit or alter the recipient's
         rights in the Source Code version from the rights set forth in this
         License. If You distribute the Executable version under a different
         license You must make it absolutely clear that any terms which differ
         from this License are offered by You alone, not by the Initial
         Developer or any Contributor. You hereby agree to indemnify the
         Initial Developer and every Contributor for any liability incurred by
         the Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result of any such
         terms You offer.

         3.7. Larger Works.
         You may create a Larger Work by combining Covered Code with other code
         not governed by the terms of this License and distribute the Larger
         Work as a single product. In such a case, You must make sure the
         requirements of this License are fulfilled for the Covered Code.

    4. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation.

         If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this
         License with respect to some or all of the Covered Code due to
         statute, judicial order, or regulation then You must: (a) comply with
         the terms of this License to the maximum extent possible; and (b)
         describe the limitations and the code they affect. Such description
         must be included in the LEGAL file described in Section 3.4 and must
         be included with all distributions of the Source Code. Except to the
         extent prohibited by statute or regulation, such description must be
         sufficiently detailed for a recipient of ordinary skill to be able to
         understand it.

    5. Application of this License.

         This License applies to code to which the Initial Developer has
         attached the notice in Exhibit A and to related Covered Code.

    6. Versions of the License.

         6.1. New Versions.
         Netscape Communications Corporation ("Netscape") may publish revised
         and/or new versions of the License from time to time. Each version
         will be given a distinguishing version number.

         6.2. Effect of New Versions.
         Once Covered Code has been published under a particular version of the
         License, You may always continue to use it under the terms of that
         version. You may also choose to use such Covered Code under the terms
         of any subsequent version of the License published by Netscape. No one
         other than Netscape has the right to modify the terms applicable to
         Covered Code created under this License.

         6.3. Derivative Works.
         If You create or use a modified version of this License (which you may
         only do in order to apply it to code which is not already Covered Code
         governed by this License), You must (a) rename Your license so that
         the phrases "Mozilla", "MOZILLAPL", "MOZPL", "Netscape",
         "MPL", "NPL" or any confusingly similar phrase do not appear in your
         license (except to note that your license differs from this License)
         and (b) otherwise make it clear that Your version of the license
         contains terms which differ from the Mozilla Public License and
         Netscape Public License. (Filling in the name of the Initial
         Developer, Original Code or Contributor in the notice described in
         Exhibit A shall not of themselves be deemed to be modifications of
         this License.)

    7. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY.

         COVERED CODE IS PROVIDED UNDER THIS LICENSE ON AN "AS IS" BASIS,
         WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING,
         WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES THAT THE COVERED CODE IS FREE OF
         DEFECTS, MERCHANTABLE, FIT FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR NON-INFRINGING.
         THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE COVERED CODE
         IS WITH YOU. SHOULD ANY COVERED CODE PROVE DEFECTIVE IN ANY RESPECT,
         YOU (NOT THE INITIAL DEVELOPER OR ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR) ASSUME THE
         COST OF ANY NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION. THIS DISCLAIMER
         OF WARRANTY CONSTITUTES AN ESSENTIAL PART OF THIS LICENSE. NO USE OF
         ANY COVERED CODE IS AUTHORIZED HEREUNDER EXCEPT UNDER THIS DISCLAIMER.

    8. TERMINATION.

         8.1.  This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate
         automatically if You fail to comply with terms herein and fail to cure
         such breach within 30 days of becoming aware of the breach. All
         sublicenses to the Covered Code which are properly granted shall
         survive any termination of this License. Provisions which, by their
         nature, must remain in effect beyond the termination of this License
         shall survive.

         8.2.  If You initiate litigation by asserting a patent infringement
         claim (excluding declatory judgment actions) against Initial Developer
         or a Contributor (the Initial Developer or Contributor against whom
         You file such action is referred to as "Participant")  alleging that:

         (a)  such Participant's Contributor Version directly or indirectly
         infringes any patent, then any and all rights granted by such
         Participant to You under Sections 2.1 and/or 2.2 of this License
         shall, upon 60 days notice from Participant terminate prospectively,
         unless if within 60 days after receipt of notice You either: (i)
         agree in writing to pay Participant a mutually agreeable reasonable
         royalty for Your past and future use of Modifications made by such
         Participant, or (ii) withdraw Your litigation claim with respect to
         the Contributor Version against such Participant.  If within 60 days
         of notice, a reasonable royalty and payment arrangement are not
         mutually agreed upon in writing by the parties or the litigation claim
         is not withdrawn, the rights granted by Participant to You under
         Sections 2.1 and/or 2.2 automatically terminate at the expiration of
         the 60 day notice period specified above.

         (b)  any software, hardware, or device, other than such Participant's
         Contributor Version, directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then
         any rights granted to You by such Participant under Sections 2.1(b)
         and 2.2(b) are revoked effective as of the date You first made, used,
         sold, distributed, or had made, Modifications made by that
         Participant.

         8.3.  If You assert a patent infringement claim against Participant
         alleging that such Participant's Contributor Version directly or
         indirectly infringes any patent where such claim is resolved (such as
         by license or settlement) prior to the initiation of patent
         infringement litigation, then the reasonable value of the licenses
         granted by such Participant under Sections 2.1 or 2.2 shall be taken
         into account in determining the amount or value of any payment or
         license.

         8.4.  In the event of termination under Sections 8.1 or 8.2 above,
         all end user license agreements (excluding distributors and resellers)
         which have been validly granted by You or any distributor hereunder
         prior to termination shall survive termination.

    9. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY.

         UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES AND UNDER NO LEGAL THEORY, WHETHER TORT
         (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), CONTRACT, OR OTHERWISE, SHALL YOU, THE INITIAL
         DEVELOPER, ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR, OR ANY DISTRIBUTOR OF COVERED CODE,

         The Covered Code is a "commercial item," as that term is defined in
         48 C.F.R. 2.101 (Oct. 1995), consisting of "commercial computer
         software" and "commercial computer software documentation," as such
         terms are used in 48 C.F.R. 12.212 (Sept. 1995). Consistent with 48
         C.F.R. 12.212 and 48 C.F.R. 227.7202-1 through 227.7202-4 (June 1995),

         rights set forth herein.

         This License represents the complete agreement concerning subject
         matter hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be
         unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent
         necessary to make it enforceable. This License shall be governed by
         California law provisions (except to the extent applicable law, if

         shall be construed against the drafter shall not apply to this
         License.
