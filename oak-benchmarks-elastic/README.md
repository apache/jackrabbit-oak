Oak Elastic Benchmark Jar
=========================

This jar is runnable and contains test related run modes.

The following runmodes are currently available:

    * benchmark       : Run benchmark tests against different Oak repository fixtures.

See the subsections below for more details on how to use these modes.

Benchmark mode
--------------

The benchmark mode is used for executing various micro-benchmarks. It can
be invoked like this:

    $ java -jar oak-benchmarks-*.jar benchmark [options] [testcases] [fixtures]

The following benchmark options are required :

    --elasticHost        - Elastic host server (e.g. localhost)
    --elasticPort        - Elastic server port (e.g 9200)
    --elasticScheme      - Eastic server scheme (e.g. http)

Example Command for benchmark execution
---------------------------------------

The below command executes ElasticPropertyFullTextSeparated

`benchmark ElasticPropertyFullTextSeparated Oak-Segment-Tar --wikipedia Path_to_wiki_dump_xml --elasticHost localhost --elasticPort 9200 --elasticScheme http`

Available benchmarks are listed
in [ElasticBenchmarkRunner](src/main/java/org/apache/jackrabbit/oak/benchmark/ElasticBenchmarkRunner.java)

Some other useful JVM parameters are -

`-Dlogback.configurationFile=<path to logback-benchmark>\logback-benchmark.xml` (Useful for
additional logging, [Sample](src/main/resources/logback-benchmark.xml))
`-Druntime=180`(Change the benchmark execution time, default is 60 seconds)
`-DskipWarmup=true`(skip warmup test execution)
