/**
 * Instances of this class represent the garbage collection generation related
 * information of a segment. It consists of the segment's generation, its full
 * generation and its compaction flag. The segment's generation records the number
 * of garbage collection cycles a segment went through and is incremented with
 * every garbage collection regardless its type. The segment's full generation
 * records the number of full garbage collection cycles a segment went through.
 * It is only incremented on full garbage collection cycles. The segment's compaction
 * flag is set for those segments that have been created by a compaction operation.
 * It is never set for segments created by normal write operations or defer
 * compactions triggered by such. Segments written by normal repository writes will
 * inherit the generation and full generation of the segment written by the previous
 * compaction process with the compacted flag cleared.
 * <p>
 * The information recorded in this way allows to determine the reclamation status
 * of a segment by just looking at the {@code GCGeneration} instances of that segment
 * and of the segment containing the repository head: Let {@code s} be a segment,
 * {@code h} be the segment containing the current repository head and {@code n} be
 * the number of retained generations.
 * <ul>
 *     <li>{@code s} is old iff {@code h.generation - s.generation >= n}</li>
 *     <li>{@code s} is in the same compaction tail than h iff
 *         {@code s.isCompacted && s.fullGeneration == h.fullGeneration}</li>
 *     <li>{@code s} is reclaimable iff {@code s} is old and {@code s} is not in the same compaction tail than {@code h}</li>
 * </ul>
